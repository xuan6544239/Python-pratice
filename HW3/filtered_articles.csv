us futures fall as week of battering by yields nears end: stock market news today,2023-10-20T11:28:19.000Z,Karen Friar,"us stocks slipped ahead of the bell on friday, with benchmark treasury yields on the retreat after spiking to 5% in the wake of comments by federal reserve chair jerome powell.
dow jones industrial average (^dji) was down about 0.2%, while s&p 500 (^gspc) futures shed around 0.3%, both on track for a losing week after thursday's sell-off. contracts on the tech-heavy nasdaq 100 (^ndx) dropped almost 0.4%.
stocks lost ground after powell signaled the fed is committed to its ""higher for longer"" rates stance, which spurred gains in treasury yields. the benchmark 10-year yield (^tnx) rose briefly to 5% late on thursday, a closely watched level not seen since july 2007.
“the underlying message is 'don’t be looking for a bailout from the fed anytime soon,'” greg whiteley, a portfolio manager at doubleline, told reuters. ""that gives people the go ahead to take rates above 5%.”
on friday, the yield on the 10-year retreated from that key level, dropping to around 4.93%, as part of a broader recovery in fixed-income assets. but the ""pain trade"" in bonds could have further to run, even after weeks of putting pressure on stocks.
investors looking to earnings to lift the downbeat mood have yet to find relief, despite strong financial reports. on the docket thursday are results from american express (axp), comerica (cma), huntington bancshares (hban).
also still weighing on shaky markets is the risk of the israel-hamas war turning into a wider middle east conflict, after israel's defense chief hinted at a ground assault on gaza at the weekend.
us futures pointed friday to a lower open as the 10-year treasury yield pulled back from a spike that took it to 5%.
futures on the dow jones industrial average (^dji) were down 0.21%, or 71 points, while s&p 500 (^gspc) futures dropped 0.30%. contracts on the tech-heavy nasdaq 100 (^ndx) fell 0.39%.

microsoft is now a gaming juggernaut,2023-10-20T19:38:33.000Z,Daniel Howley,"microsoft (msft) officially owns activision blizzard (atvi), making it the third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue behind just tencent and sony (sony). but the acquisition does more than boost microsoft’s standing in the global gaming industry. it gives the company far greater access to the mobile gaming market, lines it up for revenue via mobile games advertising, and provides it with the opportunity to grow its xbox game pass subscription service and xbox cloud gaming streaming service.
“it's certainly a seismic shift in how the money flows around the gaming ecosystem,” explained international data corporation (idc) research director lewis ward. “it is the biggest acquisition in microsoft's history. it is one of the biggest acquisitions in the tech market. it is … by anyone’s measure, a big sea change.”
but don’t expect the company to start reaping the benefits of the $69-billion deal anytime soon. microsoft still has a long way to go before it can begin to put its stamp on any of activision blizzard’s games like “call of duty” and longer still before its bet on cloud gaming pays off.
microsoft has never had much of a hand in the mobile gaming market. and while the console and pc markets are huge, bringing in $43 billion and $40 billion respectively in 2023, the mobile gaming market is even larger. according to a study by data.ai and idc, the segment will bring in a whopping $103 billion this year alone.
but with activision blizzard, microsoft is now one of the biggest players in mobile gaming. activision blizzard’s “candy crush saga” was the second-highest-grossing mobile game in the world in the first half of 2023 behind only tencent’s “honor of kings.” and as of q2 2023, activision blizzard’s king mobile division had an incredible 238 million monthly active users. that’s far more than activision’s 92 million, despite that arm running “call of duty,” or blizzard’s 26 million.
“the amount of revenue that 'candy crush' generates should not be underestimated,” said forrester senior analyst will mckeon-white. “microsoft has also traditionally had a minimal ... mobile gaming presence. so this acquisition also significantly helps out with that.”
that mobile presence also gives microsoft a significant leg up in the mobile advertising space. after all, mobile games generate money via either in-game sales or ads, and “candy crush” does both.
outside of mobile gaming, activision blizzard gives microsoft the firepower it needs to exploit its game pass subscription service and nascent xbox cloud gaming. game pass gives subscribers access to hundreds of games that they can download to their xbox consoles or pcs for $16.99 per month. the service has been a key portion of microsoft’s gaming strategy, with ceo satya nadella regularly calling out the service during the company’s earnings calls.
in january, nadella announced that the service had surpassed 120 million monthly active users. and with activision blizzard’s library of intellectual property, microsoft can make game pass an even more appealing option for gamers, giving the company more firepower to drive subscriptions over time.
then there’s the cloud gaming aspect of the deal. microsoft is the leader in cloud gaming, and has opened up the service to a slew of new devices including smart tvs and even meta’s (meta) quest 3 ar/vr headset. but cloud gaming is still in its early stages. the quality of streams doesn’t always match up to what you’d get playing games on a console or pc, and high-speed internet still isn’t available in portions of the us, let alone globally.
“in terms of cloud gaming, we're still in the active experimentation phase,” mckeon-white said. “and while the current results are much better than they were previously, it's still ... not the best possible experience for playing video games, if we’re completely honest.”
it’s also important to note that cloud gaming is still a small portion of overall gaming revenue. but, eventually, the service could power game pass subscriptions.
“i think it is a positive for cloudstream gaming,” ward said. “i think that it will be one of the drivers of growth over time, but let's not kid ourselves. right now, it's only like 2% or 3% of market revenue. it's a very small component of total market revenue.”
but as microsoft perfects the technology and high-speed internet continues to spread across the globe, xbox cloud gaming will become a far more attractive and viable option for gamers in regions where consoles and pcs are too expensive due to taxes or import restrictions.
there’s one other aspect to microsoft’s acquisition that could prove beneficial over time, and that’s how the company could take advantage of older activision blizzard properties. there are a slew of titles, such as “guitar hero,” that the gaming giant hasn’t worked on in years, and with microsoft’s backing, it could begin to dig those out of storage and breathe new life into them.
what’s more, it gives microsoft a boost to the number of first-party games it will release each year.
“there's just a critical mass that they probably weren't at prior to the acquisition, and this pushes them over the top,” wedbush analyst michael pachter told yahoo finance. “you suddenly go from maybe a half a game a year of new content under the old microsoft to four, five, plus ‘world of warcraft.’ ”
taken as a whole, the acquisition is a boon for microsoft. though it could take some time for it to begin to pay dividends. after all, with games already in development it will be a while before microsoft has any real say in how activision blizzard develops new titles.
there’s also the looming threat that the federal trade commission (ftc) could break up the companies as part of its antitrust case against microsoft. the ftc is moving forward with an in-house challenge to the deal and working on an appeal to a prior ruling against the commission’s effort to halt the move.
still, if everything pans out in microsoft’s favor, acquiring activision blizzard could be a turning point for the company, and the gaming industry as a whole.

the housing winter arrives early as existing-home sales crash to great recession levels and the long-feared ‘deep freeze’ sets in,2023-10-20T20:30:29.000Z,Sydney Lake,"after a long, hot summer that saw mortgage rates creep ever higher, october has brought an early winter for the housing market. existing-home sales dropped a stunning 15% in september on a year-over-year basis to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million transactions, according to the national association of realtors (nar). that’s the lowest figure in 13 years, since 2010, when the world economy, and particularly the u.s. housing market, were struggling to pull out of the great financial crisis.
contributing factors to the continuous decline in home transactions include surging mortgage rates (which just hit 8% this week—a record in the 21st century), low inventory levels, and home prices that refuse to stop rising. in other words, there aren’t enough homes to buy, money isn’t cheap anymore, and the ones for sale are too rich for most homebuyers’ blood.
indeed, existing-home sales prices topped $306,000, a 5% increase since the year began, according to the case-shiller u.s. national home price index.
“as has been the case throughout this year, limited inventory and low housing affordability continue to hamper home sales,” nar chief economist lawrence yun said in a statement. “the federal reserve simply cannot keep raising interest rates in light of softening inflation and weakening job gains.” the fed has raised rates several times this year, with chair jerome powell arming his “higher for longer” stance.
declining housing inventory levels also contribute to the drop in housing transactions. housing inventory is down 8.1% from this time last year, according to nar. some real-estate experts and economists argue that housing affordability is even worse now than during 2008, when a damaging downturn in the u.s. housing market set off the dominoes that became the great financial crisis that defined a whole decade economically—and in some ways, our current predicament.
in 2010, the last time existing home sales were so low, the global economy was on life support and the fed slashed interest rates down to zero to revive the flatlining patient—fueling an “everything bubble” that inflated all kinds of assets along the way, not the least, housing. the zero-rate regime persisted until the highest inflation in 40 years surprised many economists and prompted the massive series of rate hikes that have brought us to the once-unthinkable 8% mortgage.
some onlookers saw what was coming, for instance zillow, which warned in may that housing would enter a “deep freeze” if the debt limit standoff failed to resolve and america defaulted, as that would send mortgage rates up to 8%. of course, the default was averted, but here we have arrived at 8% mortgage rates anyway. but this isn’t like 2008 or 2010 again. it’s time for a 1980s history lesson.
the housing market today isn’t identical to that of the ‘80s, but it’s pretty close. in a lot of ways, millennials are being forced to follow the housing journey of their boomer parents as they face a frozen, unaffordable market with rising interest rates, as noted recently by both bofa research economist jeseo park and by first american chief economist mark fleming.
essentially, millennials are a giant generation all collectively coming of homebuying age nearly simultaneously—just like their boomer parents in the 1980s. they’re the “biggest share of the “homebuying pie,” as redfin puts it, purchasing about 60% of homes bought with mortgages during the past few years.
plus, the raising of interest rates in an effort to combat inflation is strikingly similar to the ’80s. back then, fed chair paul volcker fought inflation through aggressive interest rate hikes, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage peaking at about 18% by late 1981. sound familiar? current fed chair jerome powell has set the tone for the most aggressive global hiking of rates in the modern era. and in due course, this week, mortgage rates hit 8%, the highest they’ve been in more than 20 years.
all things considered, home sales activity also plummeted from 1978 to 1982. existing-home sales dropped 50% during that period, according to the office of policy development and research. and while we haven’t seen home sales activity levels this low since the 2000s, the housing market more closely mimics that of the ’80s, according to a report published this week by fortune 500 financial services company first american.
“today’s housing market isn’t anything like the housing market of the mid-2000s,” first american’s fleming wrote in a tuesday report titled “1980s déjà vu for the housing market.” “the housing market today is not overbuilt, nor is it driven by loose lending standards, subprime mortgages, or homeowners who are highly leveraged.”
while some economic factors are stronger today than they were during the gfc, housing affordability is undeniably worse.
“while housing and more generally consumer fundamentals are in a much stronger position today, affordability for the incremental buyer is worse than it was at the peak in 2006 before the crash,” roger ashworth, a managing director at goldman sachs, wrote in a credit strategy research paper released last week.
and he’s not hopeful we’ll see home prices drop anytime soon: “absent any negative shocks to the broader economy that would either boost excess supply of homes on the market or fuel an uptick in unemployment, we continue to expect home prices to rise at a slow pace.” in fact, he predicts we’ll see home prices rise by 1.8% by the end of the year, with a 3.5% increase by the end of 2024.
looking at more recent housing inventory data makes the issue even more stark. between september 2018 and september 2023, the average number of homes on the market dropped a whopping 60% to fewer than 700,000 active listings, according to realtor.com.
“unlike the turn of the millennium, house prices today are rising alongside mortgage rates, primarily due to low inventory,” sam khater, freddie mac’s chief economist, said in a statement released sept. 29. “these headwinds are causing both buyers and sellers to hold out for better circumstances.”
but with the development that home sales transactions are at their lowest level in the past 13 years coupled with century-high mortgage rates of 8%, many real estate experts and economists aren’t hopeful that affordability constraints will let up soon.
out of fear of losing their lower interest rates, current homeowners are resistant to putting their homes on the market, ultimately leading to the abysmal inventory levels—leaving fewer and fewer properties exchanging hands. indeed, more than 90% of existing-home owners are locked into mortgage rates below 6%, odeta kushi, deputy chief economist at first american, previously told fortune.
“these homeowners do not have a financial incentive to sell,” kushi says. “the combination of reduced affordability and an even stronger rate lock-in effect suppresses home sales because you can’t buy what’s not for sale, even if you can afford it.”

calls to empower patrick mchenry get louder as republicans again fail to pick a speaker,2023-10-18T17:37:20.000Z,Ben Werschkul,"rep. jim jordan (r-ohio) fell short for a second time in his quest for the speaker’s gavel wednesday, with more of his gop colleagues voting against him today than yesterday. the resilient opposition to his hardline candidacy is fueling new calls for a stopgap maneuver to get the house operational again.
the idea that has been put forth by both democrats and republicans in recent days would empower rep. patrick mchenry (r-n.c.) with new powers. he currently oversees the chamber as speaker pro tempore but operates with restricted powers.
for now, mchenry only has the authority to convene a vote for the next full speaker but growing his powers could at least temporarily allay some fears on wall street and in the business world about the seemingly endless dysfunction on capitol hill.
mchenry was a key architect of this spring’s debt-ceiling deal that averted a financial catastrophe and he would be faced with similar challenges in the weeks ahead, with government spending fights looming between now and the end of the year between house republicans and the senate and the white house.
depending on the scope of his power, mchenry could also theoretically push forward business world priorities, notably two ongoing cryptocurrency efforts — one bill focused on crypto’s market structure and another focused on stablecoins — that he has championed as chair of the house financial services committee.
while mchenry himself has repeatedly batted down the idea, a growing number of prominent conservative figures and organizations have warmed up to it.
three former gop house speakers — newt gingrich, john boehner, and paul ryan — have openly highlighted the idea.
in comments at harvard on tuesday, ryan called it a ""break the glass, last resort"" option but quickly added ""that’s probably where they're going to end up if jim jordan can’t put it together.""
the idea has also been espoused in various influential conservative forums like the wall street journal editorial page as well as by jordan opponents like reps. mario díaz-balart (r.-fla.) and mike kelly (r-penn.).
i am requesting that the house immediately come back for a second vote on the speaker @patrickmchenry pic.twitter.com/3eh1jw9tqj
— mario diaz-balart (@mariodb) october 17, 2023
the surge in gop support for the idea comes after the idea has been touted by democrats over the last week.
""we strongly support an immediate vote to expand the speaker pro tempore's authorities to allow for the consideration of a legislative agenda limited to the most pressing issues,"" wrote four moderate democratic lawmakers in a letter last week.
house minority leader hakeem jeffries added tuesday that there are ""ongoing informal conversations"" around bipartisan compromises.
of course the idea of empowering mchenry faces significant challenges ahead, notably from jordan and his allies who appear poised to keep fighting even after losing two rounds of voting.
any measure to empower mchenry would almost surely require both democrats' and republicans' votes and could gain the intense ire of some on the far right. for example, rep. matt gaetz (r-fla.) has already been criticizing mchenry for how he’s exercised his limited powers.
the extent and duration of mchenry’s possible powers could also be a point of contention if the idea advances further.
the various comments in support of the idea differ on significant details, such as whether mchenry should be empowered until a certain date or indefinitely.
also up for debate is whether he would be able to address any issue that arises or focus only on certain circumscribed ideas like a government shutdown and foreign aid. there is also an open question about whether an empowered speaker pro tempore would be in the presidential line of succession.
finally, mchenry himself is also a wild card. he has repeatedly downplayed the idea in comments to reporters on capitol hill.
mchenry is also a close ally of kevin mccarthy, who selected him for his current position atop the house, but has avoided calls to join the house leadership on a permanent basis for years, preferring instead to serve as chair of the financial services committee.

biden doesn't just want aid for ukraine and israel. he also wants billions to confront china.,2023-10-20T16:31:30.000Z,Ben Werschkul,"president biden doesn’t just want new money to assist with wars in ukraine and israel. he also wants billions to confront china.
following an address to the nation, where he exhorted americans to support his efforts in ukraine and israel, president biden announced the complete details of his administration's request to congress on friday.
within the nearly $106 billion supplemental funding request to congress is an ask for $7.4 billion toward china-focused efforts by his administration.
the money would be divided between $3.4 billion for america’s submarines that operate in the region, $2 billion for new financing efforts to counter china’s economic might, and another $2 billion for state department foreign military efforts.
if approved, the money could flow toward taiwan and other us allies in the region and potentially re-inflame us-china tensions after a year of tense back and forth between the two superpowers.
this money is crucial, national security advisor jake sullivan told reporters friday, as part of ""efforts to maintain peace and stability"" in the indo-pacific region adding that the new funds would represent ""significant new resources to help [us allies] build the capabilities necessary to meet emerging challenges.""
of course, the administration’s funding request will have to navigate the dysfunction on capitol hill first, as lawmakers in the house of representatives still remain deadlocked on a replacement for the ousted kevin mccarthy after more than two weeks.
""the world is watching and the american people rightly expect their leaders to come together and deliver on these priorities,"" wrote office of management and budget director shalanda young in a letter to congress on the package — which also includes more than $60 billion for ukraine, more than $20 billion for the middle east, and more than $10 billion for america’s southern border.
due to the ongoing chaos on capitol hill, her letter had to be addressed to rep. patrick mchenry (r-n.c.), the speaker pro tempore of the house of representatives. mchenry has adamantly maintained he has no power to consider the request until house republicans agree on a plan for going forward.
if approved, much of the money would be directed toward the us navy’s public shipyards to build up the us's capacity to stand up to china militarily.
the money would accelerate the building of attack submarines to patrol in the indo-pacific and help fulfill an ongoing security partnership between australia, the united kingdom, and the us, biden officials said.
the biden administration is also asking for $2 billion to ""provide a credible alternative to the people’s republic of china’s coercive and unsustainable financing for developing countries around the world,"" according to a fact sheet.
the administration says the money could be leveraged to unlock up to $21 billion in new lending opportunities through the international monetary fund and world bank.
a third tranche of the money would allot $2 billion toward general military readiness efforts in the region.
the biden administration didn’t outline precisely how much of the funds would go to taiwan, with the political status of the island a long-running source of tension. sullivan underlined friday that the funds would be spread across the entire region and not be exclusive to taiwan.
biden himself also noted in his address to the nation that his larger national security effort has at least one eye on china, especially the $61.4 billion he wants to use for ukraine's war.
""if we walk away and let putin erase ukraine’s independence, would-be aggressors around the world would be emboldened to try the same,"" he said from the oval office, saying the chaos could spread both to the indo-pacific as well as to the middle east.

why you should carefully consider what jamie dimon just told the investing world,2023-10-16T10:00:22.000Z,Brian Sozzi,"this is the takeaway from today's morning brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:
the chart of the day
what we're watching
what we're reading
economic data releases and earnings
i was sitting in a washington, d.c., hotel room for the start of bank earnings last friday morning, a.k.a. the official beginning of earnings season.
i had my normal earnings day routine in full effect: three large iced coffees nearby, a digital notebook, a pair of headphones, soft-to-the-touch lululemon clothing, and a story template open and ready to rock.
there were three things i wanted to learn from the big banks: 1) charge-off trends (we cover a lot of retail names here at yahoo finance), 2) the state of the deal market, and 3) commentary around wall street hiring trends.
i proceeded to open up the jpmorgan earnings release. per usual, i combed through the numbers along the left rail of the first page. then, per usual, i focused on the box on the bottom right of the page for the latest commentary from its ceo jamie dimon.
this comment from dimon immediately popped out: ""this may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades.""
""wow, that is pretty intense from jamie,"" i said to myself. ""never heard that tone from him before — what does it mean to the average investor?""
with that comment right there from dimon, the complexion of this earnings season has dramatically changed. the approach to investing in the market has changed into year-end, i think.
one sentence by the most powerful ceo in the game today. and when he says something like that it warrants a new way of thinking by investors.
dimon followed up on this thread on the earnings call: ""my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there, you just got to be very cautious."" he added he is concerned about government debt levels and inflation, two topics he has focused on in various venues in recent months.
you may be asking yourself why, several days later, i am still harping on these comments.
here's why.
the most powerful ceo in the world with the biggest network and the best information is using all of that to put forth guidance to his various stakeholders and followers. dimon in no way takes making a statement like that lightly. he knows the gravity of his words.
but then, in reality, dimon is quite correct in his assessment.
the israel-hamas war continues to play out on a grand stage worldwide, injecting fresh geopolitical uncertainties. the ukraine-russia war rages. all of this has ties back to china and resurfaces our contentious relationship with that country.
the us house of representatives is a flat-out mess that is making the country look bad again.‌
there is still a chance of a mid-november government shutdown. inflation is stubborn and rate hikes continue to permeate the economy. government debt levels are crazy and getting crazier.
now if you follow the warren buffett style of investing, then none of this stuff matters. you buy stocks deemed attractively valued and shuffle along for the next 75 years drinking coca-cola.
not everyone subscribes to that approach, though, and many are trying to live for today by investing in the markets or other assets. to that end, it feels appropriate to have more caution on asset allocation in the near term until some of the aforementioned issues cool down. besides, stock valuations aren't exactly cheap.‌
it often pays to listen to smart people in investing, and dimon is obviously one of the smartest people in the room.‌
in case you were wondering, i got my charge-off answer.
on jpm's media call, cfo jeremy barnum (another smart exec) told me he isn't seeing ""acute pain"" in consumers from higher interest rates. it was a fair response but i think one that suggests those retailers we follow here at yahoo finance will report tepid third quarter results.
‌hey, i am pretty smart, too.

unretiring: more retirees are going back to work because they want to — or need to,2023-10-14T12:32:03.000Z,Kerry Hannon,"richard eisenberg retired in 2022.
at 65, he stepped away from his job as managing editor for ""next avenue,"" the pbs website for people over 50, where he had worked for a decade.
""i had a rough idea of what my retirement would be,"" eisenberg told yahoo finance. ""i knew i would be 'unretiring' since i still wanted to be doing some writing, some editing, and some teaching, but not all the time.""
so far, he has. eisenberg, who lives in westfield, n.j., explores ""unretirement"" in his expert columns, podcast and teaching posts, including an online nyu master class.
""i'm seeing a lot of curiosity about the idea,"" he said. ""i'm still a little surprised that it seems like such a foreign concept to people.""
a growing number of retirees like eisenberg have stepped off the sidelines and headed back to work, especially after many were forced to retire in the pandemic, according to a new report from t. rowe price. around 7% of retirees are looking for work in retirement, while 20% say they’re already working part time or full time.
""in 2021, during the pandemic, that percentage was 10%,"" judith ward, a certified financial planner and thought leadership director at t. rowe price, told yahoo finance. ""they might have been forced to retire, and now we're seeing that they are reentering the workforce.""
read more: how to find out your 2024 social security cola increase
the two main reasons for coming back into the workforce are a tale of opposites. while 45% chose to work for social and emotional benefits like eisenberg, a slightly larger percentage — 48% — felt they needed to work for financial reasons.
older adults, those age 65 and older, represent the fastest growing group of homeless, while poverty among older americans has escalated. policymakers and researchers have also been fretting that the share of older americans with debt has risen from 38% to 63% since 1990, according to a recent report by the center for retirement research at boston college.
""many people retired during the pandemic for a variety of reasons and the financial reality of that is now hitting home,"" chris farrell, author of ""unretirement"" and ""purpose and a paycheck,"" told yahoo finance. ""working even a few hours a week can help shore up household finances.""
""they’re taking advantage of the tight labor market to unretire, often by picking up part-time work, flexible gigs, starting their own business, and even encore careers,"" farrell said.
damascus, md.-based resident gary socha, 69, who retired after being laid off during the pandemic from his publishing job, stepped back in two years ago and is now working part time, four hours a day, as an advertising and event representative.
""it was too early, and my wife is five years younger and still working,"" socha told yahoo finance. ""and financially... it just seems to make sense to make some more money and make yourself a little bit more secure and more comfortable for when you do retire. i could see doing this for quite a while.""
for other retirees, the lack of retirement planning or saving is coming back to haunt them.
""it's not uncommon for people to retire without having actually made a retirement plan, and then find some financial surprises along the way,"" mark miller, a retirement expert and author of ""retirement reboot,"" told yahoo finance. ""that can prompt some people to go back to work. and the faster pace of inflation we've been experiencing also is motivating some people to go back to work, just to help cover their living expenses.""
how much wealth you have to tap, of course, is the lynchpin. there’s a huge difference by household assets when it comes to retirees who say they ""don’t need to work,"" according to the t. rowe price report, which surveyed 2,895 401(k) retirement plan participants and 1,136 retirees with a rollover ira or a left-in-plan balance.
the report found 37% of retirees with household assets under $50,000 said they don’t need to work versus 55% of those in the $50,000-to-$250,000 category and 72% with assets of $750,000 and above.
women are particularly vulnerable. in the report, 49% of retired women who were working or looking for work said they need the money compared to 41% of men.
one reason is that many women have less savings to depend on in retirement and lower social security benefits because of time out of the workplace for caregiving.

""typically, lower incomes, higher debt loads — especially student loans — and shorter job tenures are some of the factors contributing to the gender savings gap,"" sudipto banerjee, t. rowe price’s vice president, retirement, and author of the report, told yahoo finance at the wiser annual women’s retirement symposium.
the biggest financial payoffs of additional years of paid work are pushing back retirement account withdrawals, continuing to save, and delaying claiming social security benefits.
""additional income can give you more time to contribute to your savings and it can also help you pay down debt and increase your cash reserves ahead of full retirement,"" ward said. and for those unretirees who haven’t started taking their social security benefit, delaying to claim means more money down the road.
""you’ll get a higher benefit, and it's inflation-adjusted, so that’s a good deal for many people,"" ward said.
there’s also the emotional draw of working, which is the second most-cited reason retirees choose to return to work.
many retirees see part-time work as a good transition strategy with 57% of retirees wanting to continue working in some form, the t. rowe price report found. men, in particular, were more likely to cite social connections as motivation to work.
""a lot of us want to work part-time in retirement,"" eisenberg said. ""we want to stay active, have social connections, bring in some income and to stay mentally engaged, but we also want to have time to do other things.""
plus, there’s the freedom to do what you want to do this time around, eisenberg said. that means choosing a working route that isn’t stuffed with meetings, administrative duties — all ""the parts of our former job that we didn't like so much.""
and then there are the psychological benefits that work can offer, robert laura, a retirement coach, told yahoo finance. several studies have indicated the positive mental effects of working. in fact, among older adults, retirees are more likely to experience depression compared to those who are still working, according to one recent paper.
""work provides routine, structure, connection, mental stimulus, purpose, and relevance,"" laura said. ""these are all things that many people don't realize they are losing when they leave work and that aren't easily replaced with golf, grandkids, and crossword puzzles.""

stocks close higher to kick off big earnings week: stock market news today,2023-10-16T20:04:28.000Z,"Karen Friar, Hamza Shaban and Alexandra Canal","stocks closed the day higher on monday as investors prepared for a host of corporate earnings this week. wall street also braced for heightened geopolitical tensions as the us attempted to advance efforts to contain the israel-hamas conflict.
the dow jones industrial average (^dji) increased 0.9%, or more than 300 points, while the the tech-heavy nasdaq composite (^ixic) led the day's gains, up 1.2%. the s&p 500 (^gspc) gained more than 1%.

alongside jpmorgan's results on friday, ceo jamie dimon said this may be ""the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,"" a warning that is still resonating days later.
investors remain focused on the middle east crisis — and right now on whether the us and its allies can stop the clash from drawing in other countries, especially iran. a full-blown regional conflict could send oil prices surging well above $100 a barrel, risking a global recession, some analysts believe.
crude oil futures (cl=f) and brent crude futures (bz=f) traded in a tight range on monday around $87 and $91 a barrel, respectively, after climbing almost 6% on friday.
but prices for gold and bonds fell, attracting those seeking safe havens. the 10-year treasury yield (^tnx) rose to 4.69%, recouping some of its losses from last week.
stocks finished the day solidly in the green with the tech-heavy nasdaq composite (^ixic) leading the day's gains, up 1.2%. the s&p 500 (^gspc) edged up more than 1%, while the dow jones industrial average (^dji) increased 0.9% or more than 300 points.
the predictions for an end to the earnings recession have passed their first test.
after 32 s&p 500 companies have reported earnings, companies in the index are beating wall street's expectations by an average of 9% on earnings per share, according to bank of america research's equity strategy team. in aggregate, after two quarters of declines, eps for s&p 500 companies is up 1% compared to the same quarter last year, forecasting early signs the corporate america earnings recession may be over.
in a research note monday, rbc capital's head of us equity strategy lori calvasina described the start of earnings season as ""solid"" despite the ""macro headwinds.""
despite challenges such as sticky inflation and a higher for longer stance from the federal reserve, rbc has raised its s&p 500 eps forecast. rbc sees recent macro movements driving higher s&p 500 earnings up to $223 (from $220) in 2023 and $232 (from $229) in 2024.
""the changes are driven by shifts in forecasts for the macro variables that we use in our model to forecast revenues, margins, and other inputs, and we have not made any other significant changes to our basic assumptions or methodology,"" calvasina.
as stocks gained across the board on monday, energy lagged with crude oil futures (cl=f) dropping more than 1% to trade below $87 a barrel. brent crude futures (bz=f) were down about 1.5% to trade about $90 a barrel.
the moves follow a volatile week in oil prices amid escalating fears that the latest conflict in israel could disrupt supply, especially from iran.
here are some of the stocks and cryptocurrencies leading yahoo finance’s trending tickers page in afternoon trading on monday:
lululemon (lulu): shares of the athleisure brand surged 10%, hitting their highest level since december 2021, on plans the company will join the s&p 500 index next week.
bitcoin (btc-usd): the cryptocurrency rose 5% on monday to trade near $28,000 as investors await the securities and exchanges commission’s decision regarding the first-ever spot bitcoin etf.
pfizer inc. (pfe): shares rose 3% on monday after the drugmaker cut its sales forecast for its covid-19 vaccine, citing lower demand. however, wall street analysts believe cost cuts and new drug launches could still drive growth, prompting the upswing in the stock. the news had the opposite effect on pharma companies with greater exposure to vaccine production. moderna (mrna) and biontech (bntx), pfizer's covid vaccine partner, both fell by more than 6%.
snap (snap): snap surged 12% after a leaked internal memo showed the company has lofty goals for 2024. according to the verge, citing the internal memo, snap is expected to have more than 475 million daily active users (daus) next year, above wall street estimates. advertising revenue expectations also came in higher at 20%
""taylor swift: the eras tour"" movie debuted at number one at the box office over the weekend, nabbing an estimated $95 to $97 million in domestic ticket sales, according to amc (amc).
industry estimates have come in slightly lower, hovering at just above $93 million, which would still be the second-best domestic opening weekend for the month of october — following 2019's ""joker.""
the concert film captured an additional $31 million to $33 million overseas, the theater chain projected, making it the best debut of all time for any concert film.
adding onto records, the film delivered $13 million globally for imax (imax), resulting in the biggest imax opening ever for a film by a musical artist — concert or documentary.
""it's really kind of an outside-the-box approach to moviegoing right now and something that i think we could see more of going going forward,"" shawn robbins, chief analyst at box office pro, told yahoo finance live on monday.
despite the solid showing, amc and cinemark (cnk) shares moved lower in afternoon trading on monday, sinking about 1.5% and 3%, respectively. imax shares traded mostly flat.
top 2023 domestic box office films
the release of the film comes at a critical time for theaters as the nearly five-month-long writers strike caused multiple disruptions to the release schedule. most notably, warner bros.' (wbd) ""dune"" sequel was delayed to march 2024 after it was originally scheduled for november 2023.
other studios have also reshuffled their respective programming with hollywood actors still on the picket lines. the union, sag-aftra, accused the the alliance of motion picture and television producers (amptp) of ""bullying tactics"" after talks between the two sides broke down over viewership bonuses and regulations surrounding ai.
""this is a weekend theater owners have been very thankful for in the wake of a few delays caused by the writers and actors strikes over recent months,"" robbins said. ""here we are talking about an almost $100 million opening weekend that was basically created out of thin air. this is not something something that was on the industry's radar just as recently as the end of summer.""
wall street pushed stocks higher on monday afternoon, as investors braced for a host of corporate earnings later this week.
the s&p 500 (^gspc) edged up by about 1.1%, while the dow jones industrial average (^dji) increased 1% or more than 300 points. the tech-heavy nasdaq composite (^ixic) gained 1.1%.
rite aid (rad) filed for bankruptcy protection on sunday night as the company grapples with declining sales and a looming opioid lawsuit that has hung over the retail pharmacy chain.
the bankruptcy is part of an effort to shutter unprofitable stores, address litigation over its role in the opioid pandemic and manage its debt load of roughly $4 billion.
the company said its chapter 11 bankruptcy filing will help resolve the legal claims in an ""equitable manner"" after the department of justice filed a complaint against rite aid in march for its role in the opioid crisis. the complaint alleged rite aid filled ""hundreds of thousands"" of prescriptions that didn't meet legal requirements.
in the filing, rite aid explained that the bankruptcy process will help it walk away from leases at undesirable locations, noting that the company is currently ""burdened"" by unprofitable stores that it can't exit.

tesla (tsla): shares of the electric car maker rose more than 1% monday morning as investors positioned themselves ahead of the company's earnings on wednesday. while detroit's big three automakers are still dealing with locked ongoing strikes, tesla recently missed wall street's estimates for third quarter deliveries, and margins remain a key concern for the electric vehicle maker. margins have declined throughout 2023 as the company has used price cuts to ignite demand.
bitcoin (btc-usd): the price of the dominant cryptocurrency rose 5% on monday morning after the securities and exchange commission did not appeal a recent decision on crypto asset manager grayscale's application for the approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (etf).

"tesla, ford, and gm struggle amid 'unrealistic' demand expectations for ev trucks",2023-10-19T17:34:36.000Z,Pras Subramanian,"add tesla (tsla) to the list of automakers pumping the brakes on the prospects of electric pickup trucks.
“we dug our own grave with cybertruck,” tesla ceo elon musk said during the company’s q3 earnings call on wednesday night. “special products that come along once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market, to reach volume, to be prosperous. it's fundamental to the nature of the newness.”
despite the company finally revealing a nov. 30 delivery date for the cybertruck, musk warned of “enormous challenges” in ramping up cybertruck production and that volume production of 250,000 units would not be reached until 2025.
while tesla and musk are confident in the cybertruck demand story, it seems that hasn’t been the case for other ev pickups that are currently on the market.
take ford’s (f) f-150 lightning electric pickup.
the lightning has been well received as a product, though not without some challenges, including a battery defect that affected production earlier this year and other teething pains. while the truck sold well following its release last year, recently sales have been challenged. ford reported in q3 that lightning sales fell 46% year over year to 3,503 vehicles sold.
this subsequently led to ford temporarily cutting a shift at its f-150 lightning electric pickup plant in detroit. though ford didn’t indicate demand was a problem, the wall street journal reported a united auto workers (uaw) official connected with the lightning’s rouge assembly plant claiming that “it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that our sales for the lightning have tanked.”
cost may be the biggest issue for ford at the moment. “consumers might be hesitant to pay 24% more for an ev pickup [versus a gas-powered truck] which could be causing [automakers] to rethink their ev pickup strategy until they can make them more cost competitive,” online car shopping site cargurus director of industry insights and analytics kevin roberts said to yahoo finance. roberts notes the average new listing price on cargurus (carg) at the end of september for a f-150 lightning was nearly $76,000, while a regular gas-powered f-150 was around $61,000.
ford’s crosstown rival gm (gm) has also been hearing the rumblings of demand drying for ev pickups. gm said it will delay the conversion of its orion assembly plant in michigan, which was supposed to be repurposed for the production of the chevrolet silverado ev and gmc sierra ev pickups, and will push production to late 2025 in order to “better manage capital investment while aligning with evolving ev demand.”
“evolving ev demand” is the key phrase here, as gm just started deliveries of its silverado ev work truck for commercial customers.
“brands like chevrolet, ford, and gmc made assumptions about what percentage of their future truck sales would be electric trucks. it’s clear those assumptions were unrealistic based on the current and near-term future demand for these models,” iseecars analyst and longtime industry watcher karl brauer said to yahoo finance.
brauer noted electric trucks, compared to standard evs, cost more up front and require an even larger dedicated space to store and charge. “now roll in their compromised real-world functionality, with shorter ranges even before adding passengers, payload, or a trailer, and your potential buyers get pretty scarce compared to traditional trucks,” he said.
ford addressed pricing concerns recently with new incentives in the form of $7,500 cash rebates for certain trim levels of the lightning. with ford already burning through billions on its ev efforts, price cuts like these will only eat deeper into ford’s already negative margins for evs.
all is not lost for the ev pickup sector, if lifestyle trucks like rivian’s (rivn) r1t pickup are taken into consideration.
rivian with its pickup and just released r1s suv have seen deliveries pickup recently, even as it raised prices after selling out its initial cheaper orders. rivian delivered 15,564 vehicles in the third quarter, beating wall street estimates and up 23% from the second quarter. rivian also confirmed its 52,000-unit 2023 production goal, as it tries to meet demand for its trucks.
rivian never tried to address the work truck market like ford and gm; rivian targeted coastal and higher-income buyers who were more interested in recreational activities. though rivian is far from profitable, it has been cutting costs and predicts gross profits by 2024.
brauer says rivian’s success illustrates the variation in market appetite between electric suvs and adventure pickups, and electric work trucks. “the overwhelming majority of truck buyers purchase their vehicles to satisfy real-world demands that no other vehicle can satisfy. it appears electric trucks aren’t yet capable of satisfying those needs.”
while ford and gm look to invest in their ev future and try to cater to both professional and recreational electric truck buyers, they have other problems at hand that may be curtailing ambitious ev plans. gm, ford, and stellantis, are still embroiled in a bitter uaw contract negotiation.
“uncertainty regarding the uaw strike, and the potential cost of the next labor contract, could be leading to [gm, ford, and stellantis] looking to closely watch expenses until a new contract is agreed upon,” cargurus’ roberts said.
one company that’s targeting that adventure and recreational user, and doesn’t have the uaw contract overhang, is the aforementioned tesla. and this may provide it a leg up in the unfolding ev pickup wars.
“the elephant in the room is the coming cybertruck,” roberts said. “if it’s a hit then we’ll probably see oems [original equipment manufacturers] get more aggressive with launches.”
iseecars’ brauer predicts a big initial reaction for the cybertruck, but mass adoption isn’t likely.
“tesla’s customer profile is all about early adopting, ensuring plenty of initial excitement for its first truck. but when it comes to long-term demand and sales volume, it will not be another model y,” brauer said. “tesla's buyers are not, by nature, truck buyers. and truck buyers, as we now know, are not by nature electric vehicle buyers. after the initial rush, cybertruck sales will be like model s and model x sales — a fraction of tesla’s total volume.”
tesla, and its legacy rivals ford and gm, will be hoping truck buyers will eventually embrace ev pickups as pricing comes down and charging infrastructure improves. it just may not come soon enough as precious capital is allocated for products that consumers want right now, or at least in the near future.

'fog on the horizon': ceos brace for recession,2023-10-14T11:30:59.000Z,Seana Smith,"wall street’s great debate of 2023 — whether the us economy is headed for a recession — is resurfacing amid escalating unrest in the middle east.
heightened geopolitical risk, along with unabating inflationary pressures, surging bond yields, and the federal reserve’s ""higher for longer"" vision, has business leaders bracing for a contraction.
“there’s a lot of fog on the horizon,” kpmg us ceo paul knopp told yahoo finance live, citing geopolitical tensions as one of the top risks to the economy.
seventy-two percent of ceos are preparing for a us recession over the next 12-18 months, according to the conference board’s survey of business leaders. while that’s an improvement from the start of the year, expectations about the short-term economic outlook have darkened.
big bank ceos are among those weighing in on a more uncertain economic outlook. jpmorgan chase (jpm) ceo jamie dimon pointed to a number of potential risks, including a sober warning on geopolitical crises abroad. citigroup (c) ceo jane fraser noted “an increasingly cautious consumer” in the bank’s earnings release friday.
fraser’s note of cracks beginning to form in consumer spending is something that’s been highlighted recently. constellation brands (stz) ceo bill newlands told yahoo finance live this week that shoppers are already ""spending a little less"" while being more ""careful"" about what they buy.
the reason this is problematic is because the resilient consumer has helped the us economy defy recession predictions so far this year, as consumer spending accounts for nearly 70% of us gdp.
and if you look at the recent sentiment data, it’s not too encouraging. consumer sentiment plunged in october to its lowest level in five months, driven in large part by households expecting higher inflation next year.
and sticky inflation is not just an issue for consumers, but for the fed too. the latest data from the bureau of labor statistics showed prices held steady at 3.7% in september, well above the fed's goal of 2%.
“with the fed committed to returning inflation back to its long-run target of 2%, this would raise the odds of rate increases this year, extend the duration of restrictive monetary policy, and increase the chances of a recession occurring down the road,” oxford economics lead us economist michael pearce wrote in a note to clients this week.
to sum it up: the probability of a recession is still anyone’s guess, but it’s safe to say the economic outlook remains murky. sofi’s (sofi) head of investment strategy liz young put it perfectly: “we are not out of the woods just yet,” she told yahoo finance. “it could still get worse before it gets better.”

younger adults are upbeat about their financial future even though many are struggling,2023-10-15T18:00:39.000Z,Dylan Croll,"young adults are surprisingly optimistic about their own financial futures despite crushing inflation and lingering fears of recession.
a new study found that 80% of americans between the ages of 18 and 34 are struggling or merely surviving financially. but the vast majority — 72% — believe they'll be thriving in five years and 79% expect to get there in 30 years, according to the study from edward jones and mit’s agelab next360, which polled 2,003 adults in that age group.
the study offers insight into what this cohort wants from their lives as they age, and reveals how personal finance advice could help them overcome the challenges they face in getting there.
""while some feel like they're just surviving, maybe barely keeping their head above water, they must feel deep down, 'i just need a few years. i need one break. just one break in my life to finally pay this student loan off or this credit card debt,'"" said andrew herzog, a financial planner at the watchman group. ""if i just got that monkey off my back, i could finally really start climbing that ladder.""

overall, the study found only 21% said they’re ""thriving"" now, while 57% said they’re ""surviving,"" and 23% said they’re struggling. but in five years, 72% see themselves ""thriving,"" with just 22% forecasting they’ll still be just ""surviving"" and 6% saying they'll still be struggling. in 30 years, there’s greater optimism — 79% envision themselves as thriving, while only 16% said they would be surviving and 4% said they would be struggling.
the study also revealed that these adults share many of the same life goals as previous generations. the survey found that 80% have or want children and that 65% of study participants hope to be homeowners one day. meanwhile, 2 in 3 have married or expect to in the future.
but despite their ambition and optimism, these adults face many challenges getting to where they want to be. these adults reported that basic living expenses and rising inflation are the biggest obstacles to achieving their five-year goals.
just 13% have paid off college debt, only 31% have a retirement account, and 57% have health insurance, according to the study. nearly 20% have already been laid off from a job.
""for those who are planning to have kids or just had or had kids, health care, childcare is incredibly expensive. daycare for myself is about the cost of my mortgage,"" said eric scruggs, a financial planner at hark financial planning. ""and so there's a lot to balance with the cost of living, and wages haven't particularly kept up.""
the study also pointed out that many members of this group grew up in the shadow of the great recession, which influenced their relationship with money.
""they saw parents lose their jobs and homes,"" lena haas, head of wealth management advice and solutions at edward jones, said. ""and so i think that having that experience, really shapes the desire of this generation to create a solid financial foundation. it's not just about the money. it's about having peace of mind and security.""
to do that, these adults will need to balance their desire for meaning and flexibility at work with their hope for the benefits of a more traditional life, which can be expensive, scruggs said.
""you've got to balance what you want to accomplish today and working maybe in a career that you may find more personally meaningful than financially rewarding, but making sure that that doesn't set you back for achieving your other longer term goals and objectives,"" said scruggs. ""and at least, if nothing else, understand the trade off you're making so that you're making an informed choice. according to the study, nearly 80% handle their finances without the help of a financial planner. but of that group, over 40% they plan on working with one someday. the study found that nearly 70% view financial advisers as ""a sounding board for ideas.""

instead, right now these adults rely on various other sources for financial advice. over 50% speak to their parents about financial planners and surprisingly, despite their tech forward image, only 20% reported ""using social media or influencers as sources of financial guidance,"" according to the study.
nearly 70% of survey participants said they don’t have money for professional advice, but scruggs noted that professional help is becoming more accessible.
""there's more and more advisers launching business models specifically for this next gen set of clients that can help them in a cost-effective manner and help set up solid foundations and solid habits,"" he said. ""that, like i said, will compound over decades to lead to meaningfully different retirement for these folks.""

student loan borrowers will get a hand in saving for retirement next year,2023-10-15T17:00:50.000Z,Ronda Lee,"a new federal rule next year will make it easier for borrowers paying back their student loans to also save for their retirement.
section 110 of the secure 2.0 act, legislation signed into law last december, will allow employers to provide 401(k), 403(b), or simple ira matching for qualified student loan payments. the provision is optional and effective january 2024.
this change helps to address a longstanding challenge for most borrowers: paying back student debt prevents them from saving for other goals, a problem that has resurfaced now that federal loan payments are no longer on pause. additionally, this provision can benefit employers as far as retention, reducing attrition, and recruiting new talent.
""it’s impossible to ignore the long-term financial impact student loan repayments can have on employees across all generations,"" eric stevenson, president of nationwide retirement solutions, said in a statement. ""the good news is secure 2.0 act now allows employers to provide matching retirement plan contributions based on the amount of an employee’s student debt repayments — a provision nationwide advocated for and is excited to further innovate on.""
read more: should you refinance your student loans?
around 67% of graduates with student loans said the debt prevents them from contributing to things like a retirement plan, according to a 2023 fidelity study. for borrowers earning less than $50,000, 77% said student loan payments would affect retirement savings, according to a corebridge study.
one in 10 employees over the age of 45 have student loan debt and 61% agree repayment has negatively impacted their financial stability, according to a nationwide survey, with 66% noting repayment will significantly affect their ability to save for retirement.
with the average borrower having a monthly payment between $200 and $500, that's real money that can help secure borrowers' futures.
read more: tips and tricks for quickly paying off student loans
""for example, if an employee has a $300 monthly student loan payment and can’t afford 401(k) contributions, the student loan payments are treated as 401(k) contributions,"" ross solverud, retirement plan compliance leader at sentry insurance, told yahoo finance. ""as of 2024, employers have the option to 'match' student loan payments as if the loan payments were 401(k) contributions.""
but it isn’t limited to employees who haven’t made contributions. if an employee isn’t maximizing their full match due to student loan payments, they will also benefit from the provision.
""if an employee has a salary of $60,000 with a 5% match on 401(k) contribution, but only contributes 3% due to $600 a month in student loan payments, they are leaving 2% or $1,200 on the table,"" stevenson said. ""with the secure 2.0 provision, they’ll be able to use their student loan payments towards the 2% to get the full 5% match.""
around 49% of employers plan to offer the matching qualified student loan payment provision, according to a survey by the employee research benefits institute (erbi).
""employers can adopt the benefit in a variety of ways, so long as they have a matching provision, and the student loan payments are for qualified student loans,"" amanda hahnel, vice president and head of student debt retirement at fidelity investments, told yahoo finance. ""additionally, employees need to certify the amount of payments paid.""
qualified student loans can be for private or federal loans, so long as they were incurred by the employee for qualified higher education expenses of the employee, which is typically considered the cost of attendance like tuition, room and board, books, and fees.
read more: are federal or private student loans better?
""employers provide information about student loan payments, track payments, and at the end of the year the employer matches up to contribution limits,"" hahnel. ""some employers may choose to allow employees to do a self-certification, which means an understanding of what's allowable, like the type of loan.""
the certification process may vary from monthly, quarterly, or annually depending on the employer.
""the legislation requires at least an annual certification, but is fairly broad, giving the employer the ability to create the process and procedures around certification,"" stevenson said.
employees have until three months after the year-end to claim the benefit, if offered by their employer. because this is a voluntary provision, with open enrollment occurring, employees should ask their human resources or benefits manager whether they plan to adopt the provision.
""we never want to leave an employer match on the table and qualified student loan payments should be no different,"" jim mahaney, a certified financial planner at mavericus retirement services llc, told yahoo finance. ""i would counsel clients to determine in the fourth quarter if they are potentially missing out on any remaining potential 401(k) employer match and to do a one-time prepayment of principal to their student loan if they are.""
""with women retiring with 30% less than men and 54% of black americans not having enough savings to retire, this provision helps,"" doug ornstein, wealth manager and a certified financial adviser at tiaa, told yahoo finance.
more than 81% of businesses said employees have asked about more steps to prepare for retirement and 39% noticed an increase in employees leaving for jobs with better benefits over the past year, according to the nationwide survey.
because it is a voluntary provision, employee demand will be a big driver for employers to participate.
""between student loans, interest rate increases and inflation, employees have a lot to navigate when planning for retirement,"" stevenson said. ""there is a strong business imperative for employers to help.""

two long-shot options to restart the house if jim jordan isn’t elected speaker,2023-10-17T18:49:05.000Z,Ben Werschkul,"republicans fell short yet again in their effort to agree on a next speaker of the house as rep. jim jordan (r-ohio) didn't have the votes on his first ballot before the full house of representatives.
twenty republican lawmakers voted against their colleague for the gavel, higher than many jordan allies had expected, dooming his bid at least on tuesday afternoon's first ballot.
jordan is set to push for more votes, telling reporters on the way into the chamber ""whatever it takes to get a speaker today."" but he could face a difficult challenge in the hours and days ahead in changing the minds of his opponents while also holding his own fragile coalition together.
in his own quest for job earlier this year, kevin mccarthy saw 19 republicans vote against him on the first ballot before he eventually prevailed following 15 grueling rounds of voting.
the latest round of gop dysfunction is sure to renew the focus on various long-shot options that have been circulating for days as ways to eventually restart the paralyzed lower chamber and address pressing issues such as aid for israel and a government shutdown deadline in just one month's time.
in a floor speech just before voting commenced, rep. pete aguilar (d-calif.) alluded to one of the options. he said if republicans can’t come together ""there is still a path forward"" for the parties to band together for a bipartisan vote on at least some issues like keeping the government open.
""it’s that simple, mr. speaker,"" he added, ""we can do it today.”
a second idea in the mix would be to expand the limited powers that the current overseer of the house enjoys.
here is a closer look at two options that could be on the table in the days ahead if the gop dysfunction continues:
one option increasingly being bandied about is a consensus speaker that could be elected with both republican and democratic votes.
house minority leader hakeem jeffries has repeatedly called for this option and reiterated the possibility over the weekend, telling nbc sunday that ""informal"" conversations are underway.
""we are ready, willing, and able to enter into a bipartisan governing coalition,"" jeffries said, adding a hope that the talks will get more concrete this week while also saying the democrat price for such a compromise would be less republican control over what reaches the floor for a vote.
the effort faces opposition from conservative republicans and there is not a clear consensus candidate, but democrats hope talks could heat up in the days ahead.
for his part, jordan has tried to head off the bipartisan idea all week. he said in a post on x sunday that ""differences between republicans and democrats in the house far outweigh our differences in the republican conference.""
after tuesday’s failed vote, jordan began meeting directly with the holdouts apparently both to try and change their minds but also stop any interest in a bipartisan solution.
another possibility would be the for current overseer of the house, rep. patrick mchenry (r. n.c.), to assume expanded powers and then use them to address issues like a government shutdown or aid to israel.
according to the rules, mchenry currently only has the power to convene a vote for the next speaker but some lawmakers say he could quickly be given the authority to convene votes on legislation.
""we strongly support an immediate vote to expand the speaker pro tempore's authorities to allow for the consideration of a legislative agenda limited to the most pressing issues,"" wrote four moderate democratic lawmakers in a recent letter even as mchenry himself has often repeatedly batted away the suggestion.
indeed, empowering mchenry appears to be more popular with democrats than with republicans at the moment. some on the far right — notably rep. matt gaetz (r-fla.) — have been criticizing mchenry for even how he’s exercised his limited powers. but the maneuver could see increasing moderate support if the stalemate continues.
""my opinion is that the longer this drags on, the more authority the speaker pro tempore will be authorized,"" says henrietta treyz, veda partners managing partner and director of economic policy research, in a recent interview.
it's ""maybe the path of least resistance at this point,"" she added.

big banks are benefiting from higher rates. their customers aren't.,2023-10-15T11:47:10.000Z,David Hollerith,"higher interest rates are lifting the fortunes of the nation’s biggest banks. they aren’t doing the same for the banks’ customers.
earnings for jpmorgan chase (jpm), citigroup (c), and wells fargo (wfc) all rose in the third quarter largely because high rates allowed them to rake in more interest income.
their scale allows them to leverage those rates by charging more for loans while holding down how much more they pay for deposits when compared to smaller rivals.
these advantages show up in a key profitability metric known as net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks make on their loans and pay for their deposits.
that number was up by sizable amounts at all three banks when compared to the same period a year ago. together the lenders pulled in a record $50 billion, 18% more than the same period last year. jpmorgan and wells fargo even lifted their guidance for how much net interest income they would earn for the full year.
yet there were also clear signs that some of their borrowers are starting to struggle. jpmorgan, citigroup, and wells fargo all increased the amount of loans they wrote off as losses. the combined charge-offs at those three banks totaled $3.98 billion, up 31% from the previous quarter and 105% from the same period a year ago.
the total was the highest amount collectively for the three lenders since the early days of the pandemic, in the second quarter of 2020.
at citigroup, ceo jane fraser warned that us consumers were cutting back. “continued deceleration in spending indicates an increasingly cautious consumer,” she said in a release.
affluent customers, she added, are accounting for almost all of the spending growth and weakness is showing among those with lower credit scores. citi expects its credit card losses to reach pre-covid levels by the end of the year.
wells fargo ceo charlie scharf said even as the economy remains resilient “we are seeing the impact of the slowing economy with loan balances declining and charge-offs continuing to deteriorate modestly.”
wells fargo had charge-offs of $850 million, $622 million from consumer loans. the bank expects its net interest income to fall 3% from the third quarter to the fourth.
""where wells fargo sees weaknesses,"" according to cfo mike santomassimo, is in commercial real estate, and ""i think we will see some loss pickup in that portfolio over time.""
jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon struck a more somber tone. he said consumers and businesses “generally remain healthy” but consumers are spending down their excess cash buffers at a time when inflation risks remain elevated, increasing the possibility that interest rates could go even higher.
wars in ukraine and israel, he added, could also impact energy, food markets, global trade, and geopolitical relationships.
""this may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,"" he said.
he admitted that the bank has been “over-earning on both net interest income and below normal credit costs, both of which will normalize over time.” he told reporters there is a “big debate” within the bank about when that normalization will happen.
“i personally think it will happen a little sooner than jeremy,” he said, referring to his cfo.
dimon, s&p global market intelligence director for financial institutions research nathan stovall told yahoo finance on friday, was “trying to throw out some caution.”
the bank, he added, knows credit costs are going to go up. “they are trying to prepare the street that you could see tougher times ahead.”
one regional bank, pnc (pnc), demonstrated the problems that smaller lenders have navigating this period of higher rates. its profits and revenue fell from a year ago, as did its net interest income. it expects net interest income to fall again in the fourth quarter when compared to the third.
the pittsburgh bank said it would reduce its staff by roughly 4%, saving $325 million. several other regional banks, including truist (tfc), have also eliminated jobs in recent months as they adjust to more uncertain economic conditions.
pnc’s stock fell 3% friday while citigroup's stock sold off slightly in the later part of the day. jpmorgan and wells fargo both rose.
""the inflection point,"" pnc ceo william demchak said in response to a question about whether pnc's net interest income had reached a trough, ""i think is entirely dependent on what happens with the fed in the coming year.""

jay powell will keep saying inflation is too high until consumers believe him,2023-10-20T10:00:20.000Z,Hamza Shaban,"this is the takeaway from today's morning brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:
the chart of the day

what we're reading
economic data releases and earnings
there’s a reason fed chair powell keeps saying inflation is too high, and it’s not just because the numbers say so.
banging a hammer of repetition is an attempt to set expectations. and where inflation is concerned, what americans think will happen has a way of becoming what happens, just as the fed’s threats of more rate hikes are meant to foreshadow a future course of monetary policy.
""doing too little could allow above-target inflation to become entrenched and ultimately require monetary policy to wring more persistent inflation from the economy at a high cost to employment,"" powell said in a speech thursday before the economic club of new york.
fed officials, in their own washington dialect of hyper-guarded and abstract language, tell the public what they will do to achieve their inflation goal. that’s meant to build a sense of trust and shape expectations: if the rate of inflation rises or holds stubbornly high, the public can expect tightening from the fed.

the central bank’s inflation target of 2% in part defines what people think inflation will be, which in turn becomes the actual rate of inflation. but a theoretical self-fulfilling prophecy has its real-world hiccups.
consumers are growing increasingly worried about inflation’s sting — and don't believe powell will make it go down.
the first october reading of the university of michigan consumer sentiment index showed americans expect prices to rise 3.8% over the next year, the highest level in five months. and the pessimism has grown slightly over the long run too, with consumers expecting costs to rise 3% over the next five to 10 years, up from a prior reading of 2.8%. compared to the two years before the pandemic, these long-run inflation expectations remain elevated.
powell acknowledged these risks of persistent price pressures in his thursday speech.
in 2020, the federal reserve altered its approach of adhering to a hard 2% inflation target and adopted a new goal that averages 2% inflation over time. even with that added flexibility, the fed has drawn criticisms that its inflation goal is no longer suited for the times.
altering the target would puncture the fed’s credibility, proponents of the 2% benchmark say, and would undermine the self-reinforcing dynamic of setting price expectations and seeing them play out in the world.
the fed’s forward guidance and its use of public communications to steer policy can look and sound a lot like wishful thinking. in some ways it is. but it does have real impacts. the threat of a hike can almost function like another phantom rate hike. part of getting that desired outcome is repeating again and again that it will happen until it does.
this messaging campaign isn't new. in a 2022 address, former fed chair ben bernanke said that the role inflation expectations play in monetary policy rests on two key premises: that expectations are an important element of actual inflation and that the actions and remarks of central bankers can further influence what people think and economic outcomes.
but powell and co. need to sell it since the inflation people experience depends partly on what people expect it to be. and as temporary, elevated rates of inflation harden in the minds of consumers, that can shift their expectations further, in effect cementing a more pessimistic vision of price increases into reality.

""of all the new data points, we think the biggest surprise is the immediate and substantial price hikes in three of netflix’s largest revenue markets,"" moffettnathanson analyst michael nathanson wrote in reaction to the report on thursday.
netflix's basic and premium plans will now cost $11.99 and $22.99, respectively, in the us. that's up from the prior $9.99 and $19.99 price points. the company's $6.99 ad-supported plan and $15.49 standard plan will stay the same price.
""by [raising prices], netflix is further incentivizing new and existing members to sign up for its materially lower priced ad-supported plan while also driving arm, [or average revenue per membership], among households that are either price inelastic and/or advertising adverse,"" the analyst continued.
nathanson, who maintained his neutral rating and price target of $390 on the stock, raised his fourth quarter and full-year 2024 revenue projections by 2.6% and 3.5%, respectively, citing the price hikes.
he also estimated arm will jump between 8% and 9% in the three markets impacted by the pricing changes, assuming no major changes in subscriber behavior.
arm decreased 1% year over year in the third quarter, although netflix said the pricing changes will help significantly boost the metric in the quarters to come.
""netflix rolled out a series of upside surprises across a variety of 2023 and 2024 metrics that have the net effect of materially lifting 2023 free cash flow and 2024 eps,"" nathanson said. ""this will undoubtedly be the read of the market, which will help stabilize netflix’s recently turbulent stock price.""
netflix shares, although up more than 30% year to date, are still down 15% over the past three months.

federal reserve chair jerome powell weighed on the debate surrounding how rising bond yields should impact the fed's interest rate hike path during a speech on thursday.
""i think we have to let this play out and watch it,"" powell said the economic club of new york on thursday. ""but for now it's clearly a tightening in financial conditions and so we'll be watching it carefully.""
bond yields have soared since the last time the fed met in late september. yields on both the 10-year and 30-year treasuries are at 16-year highs, and some fed officials have remarked that the financial tightening brought on by an increase in yields could effectively take place of another federal reserve interest rate hike.
""are we seeing the [increases] in longer bonds come through in financial conditions in a persistent way? i think if you look at financial conditions indexes, the answer is yes you are,"" powell said. ""persistence will be a matter of just seeing with our own eyes.""
powell stressed several times that yields aren't moving higher because of shorter term policy moves or market expectations of their short-term policy moves. because if markets had priced yields higher because of an expectation the fed would hike, ""you'd have to follow through,"" powell said.
""but that doesn't seem to be the case,"" powell said. ""it doesn't seem to be principally about expectations of us doing more.""
the leader of the us central bank has taken notice of the recent run of hot economic data.
""we've certainly got a resilient economy on our hands,"" federal reserve chair jerome powell said during a speech at the economic club of new york on thursday.
powell specifically highlighted this week's september retail sales report, which showed sales grew at twice the rate economists had expected, noting this shows consumer spending remains strong, though growth is not coming at a rapid rate.
other data points have also pointed to a resilient us economy since powell's last press conference on september 20, including a blowout september jobs report, and data out thursday that showed weekly jobless claims are at their lowest levels since january.
powell described the economic story this as one of ""much stronger demand” than had been expected, but didn't say this dynamic would explicitly lead to more interest rate hikes.
""it may just be that rates have not been high enough for long enough."" powell said. ""it may take more time.""
federal reserve chair jerome powell is speaking at the economic club of new york on thursday. his prepared remarks noted the fed has been attentive to the rise in bond yields and hotter than expected economic data.
yahoo finance's jennifer schonberger reports:
federal reserve chair jay powell said inflation is still too high and warned that more interest rate increases are still possible if the economy stays surprisingly hot or a tight labor market stops easing.""
additional evidence of persistently above-trend growth, or that tightness in the labor market is no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy,"" powell said in remarks thursday before the economic club of new york.
powell’s comments set the table for the central bank’s next interest-rate setting meeting on nov. 1, coming just days before a 10-day blackout period during which fed officials are not allowed to make any public statements.
the fed at its september meeting held interest rates steady at a 22-year high while signaling another rate hike will be needed later this year to bring inflation back to its 2% target.
investors currently expect the central bank to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at the november meeting, staying in the range of 5.25%-5.50%.
powell made it clear thursday the central bank is closely watching the surge in long-term bond yields, which have risen more than 50 basis points since the fed’s last policy meeting on september 20. other fed officials have said in recent days that if long-term interest rates remain elevated there may be less need for the fed to act.
""we remain attentive to these developments because persistent changes in financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy,"" powell said.
powell said in his speech that while inflation showed progress over the summer, the data from september were somewhat less encouraging.
he acknowledged that shorter-term measures of core inflation — inflation measures that strip out volatile food and energy prices — over the most recent three and six months are now running below 3%.
""but these shorter-term measures are often volatile,"" he said. ""inflation is still too high, and a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.""
the federal reserve admits it's still a long way from meeting its inflation target, recently forecasting it may not get there until 2026. but as the inflation fight lingers on some think the central bank's 2% inflation target just isn't the right number.
yahoo finance's hamza shaban reports: 
the dependence on economic data that has been a guiding light of jerome powell's tenure at the federal reserve is also one of its great weaknesses, said mohamed el-erian, in a new interview with yahoo finance's julie hyman on thursday.
in critical remarks of the us central bank, the president of queens' college, cambridge, and chief economic adviser at allianz, said that powell's emphasis on backward looking data, which operates with a lag, has denied the economy and market observers the clarity and vision that were present under previous eras of the fed.
el-erian pointed to the sharp rise in treasury yields as a cause for concern.
in addition to the higher borrowing costs for both households and businesses and the drag on the economy, he emphasized the abrupt climb of yields. ""there's fear, and i hope it's just a fear, that this could break something.""
treasury yields have continued their march higher, with the 10-year treasury reaching 4.9% for the first time since 2007 in a move that has dragged the stock market lower. as investors sell bonds, prices fall and yields rise. and as this year's sell-off in the bond market deepens, yahoo finance's jared blikre reports, there's increasing worry that an approach towards a big, round number like 5% for 10-year yields can serve as a psychological magnet for investors, lifting yields even higher.
for el-erian, fed policy is no longer an anchor. ""it's too backward-looking,"" he said. ""so this is really a hard time for the bond market. and we need stability. we desperately need stability.""
powell is scheduled to speak later today, amid the escalating conflict in gaza and ongoing geopolitical tensions. el-erian said he'd like the fed chair to pull back from an approach that is ""excessively data dependent."" instead, he'd like powell to recognize that ""you cannot drive a car on a curvy road looking through the back-view mirror,"" he said.
week by week, jobless claims can provide a volatile reading of how many people are filing for unemployment claims.
but in aggregate, this data point has been telling a clear story since january: the labor market remains strong and any weakness isn't being driven by layoffs.
198,000 jobless claims were filed last week, below consensus estimates from economists for 210,000 claims and the lowest reading since january. nancy vanden houten oxford economics lead us economist said this is just one of several economic datapoints that could tilt the federal reserve to hike interest rates once more.
""our current forecast is for no additional rate hikes, and we think a hike at the november 1 meeting is unlikely,"" vanden houten wrote in a note on thursday. ""the recent strength of the data, including the september reports on employment and retail sales, have raised the odds of another hike at a later meeting and make it more likely that the fed will start cutting rates later than we expect next year. the fed will need to see more softening of labor market conditions to be persuaded that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2% before embarking on rate cuts.""
netflix stock popped more than 15% in morning trading after a blowout quarter for the streaming giant.
yahoo finance's alexandra canal reports: 
netflix (nflx) said its operating margins have more room to run as the streamer leans on initiatives like its crackdown on password sharing, cheaper ad-supported tier, and newly announced price hikes.
""we don't think we're anywhere near a margin ceiling. we've got a long runway of margin growth,"" netflix cfo spencer neumann said on the company's third-quarter earnings call on wednesday.
operating margin, a key profitability metric, hit 22.4% in the quarter, slightly ahead of netflix's own projection of 22.2%. the company said it expects full-year operating margin to hit 20% — the high end of its previous forecast of 18% to 20%.
the update is an encouraging sign for investors who have been hyper-focused on the company's margin outlook after neumann doubled down last month on full-year margins falling in the range of 18% to 20%. consensus estimates are just below 20% for full-year 2023.
starting wednesday, netflix said its basic and premium plans will now cost $11.99 and $22.99, respectively, in the us. that's up from the prior $9.99 and $19.99 price points. netflix’s $6.99 ad-supported plan and $15.49 standard plan will stay the same price.
management said the price hikes will help improve average revenue per membership, or arm, which decreased 1% year over year in the quarter, along with other metrics like operating margins.
""while we mostly paused price increases as we rolled out paid sharing, our overall approach remains the same — a range of prices and plans to meet a wide range of needs, and as we deliver more value to our members, we occasionally ask them to pay a bit more,"" the company said in its shareholder letter.
""our starting price is extremely competitive with other streamers and at $6.99 per month in the us, for example, it’s much less than the average price of a single movie ticket,"" the letter continued.
tesla (tsla) stock dropped more than 8% on thursday in reaction to the company's latest quarterly earnings release.
yahoo finance's pras subramanian reports:
the electric vehicle maker missed on both the top and bottom lines, though the company did reveal that cybertruck deliveries are on track for november 30 of this year.
for the quarter, tesla reported top-line revenue of $23.4 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $24.06 billion; however, revenue did climb 13% from a year ago. from a profitability standpoint, tesla reported adjusted earnings per share (eps) of $0.66 versus $0.74 expected and adjusted net income of $2.3 billion versus the $2.56 billion expected.
the drop in profitability could be attributed to expected downward pressure on margins since tesla began its cost-cutting efforts late last year. tesla reported q3 gross margin of 17.9%, slightly missing wall street estimates of 18.0%. last quarter tesla reported a gross margin of 18.2%.
""the quarter itself delivered auto [gross margin] (ex credits) of 16.3% vs. the street at 17.6% with margins that should stabilize over the coming quarters however tesla is not committing to the end of price cuts and that is a big problem and overhang for the stock in the near-term,"" wedbush analyst dan ives wrote in a note published thursday morning. wedbush lowered its tesla price target to $310 from $350 following q3 earnings.
looking ahead to future products, tesla revealed cybertruck deliveries remain on track for later this year, with deliveries beginning on nov. 30. on the conference call, musk said it would take a year to 18 months before the cybertruck would be cash-flow positive, and that by 2025 he expected a production run rate of 250,000 units a year. musk added that tesla would face ""enormous challenges"" in reaching volume production of the cybertruck.
""we believe the 3q report will add to near-to-intermediate term investor concerns given company commentary that the current macro backdrop/higher rates could gate its growth (including how quickly it ramps factories), and comments that the initial cybertruck ramp could be slow,"" goldman analyst mark delaney wrote in a note to investors. delaney subsequently lowered his tesla price target to $235 from $265 following the q3 report.

fed's mester still views one more rate hike as appropriate,2023-10-20T16:15:31.000Z,Jennifer Schonberger,"cleveland fed president loretta mester said friday that she still sees the possibility of one more rate hike this year.
the central bank has projected one more rate hike this year and indicated that rates would be held at elevated levels for a while. mester reiterated friday that stance was appropriate.

mester said she still views inflation risks to the upside, pointing to higher oil prices since july that could seep into core prices and higher gas prices that could make consumers think inflation will be rising again.
""i don’t expect that this is going to move inflation back up to the very high levels we saw last year, but it could stall the progress we have seen over the past few months,"" said mester. ""the cpi report for september is a reminder that we cannot count on the progress continuing at the same good pace we have seen in recent months.""
mester says whether the fed’s benchmark policy rate needs to move higher than its current level and for how long it needs to remain restrictive will hinge on how the economy evolves.
while monetary policy is ""restrictive,"" mester says the resilience the economy has shown in the face of high interest rates has underscored the difficulty of knowing precisely how restrictive policy is partly because of the uncertainty about the level of the so-called neutral real interest rate, or the rate that neither boosts nor pushes down growth adjusting for inflation.
“regardless of the decision made at our next meeting, if the economy evolves as anticipated, in my view, we are likely near or at a holding point on the funds rate as we accumulate more information on economic and financial developments and assess the effects of the tightening in financial conditions that has already occurred,” she said.
mester noted that if the increase in longer-term treasury yields is sustained, that will help to moderate demand and will be one of the factors she’s considering when evaluating whether to raise rates further.
the yield on the 10-year treasury has risen more than 50 basis points since the fed’s last policy meeting on sept. 20, hitting 5% thursday, the highest level since 2007.
mester’s comments on yields echo other fed officials, including fed chair powell, who have said in recent days that if long-term interest rates remain elevated there may be less need for the fed to act.
mester’s comments come a day before a 10-day blackout period during which fed officials are not allowed to make any public statements.
fed chair jerome powell signaled thursday the central bank could hold rates steady at its next policy meeting, but also warned that inflation was still too high and that more interest rate increases are still possible if the economy stays surprisingly hot.
mester says the fed must manage the risk of raising rates too much with not raising rates enough, balancing bringing inflation down without plunging the economy into a deep recession.

us futures reach for gains amid surging treasury yields: stock market news today,2023-10-19T11:07:23.000Z,Karen Friar,"us stock futures hugged the flatline on thursday, attempting to rebound from a selloff as treasury yields marched higher and investors awaited a speech by federal reserve chair jerome powell.
dow jones industrial average (^dji) futures were broadly unchanged, while benchmark s&p 500 (^gspc) futures were about 0.1% higher. contracts on the tech-heavy nasdaq 100 (^ndx) rose almost 0.3%.
treasury yields climbed for the fourth day in a row, keeping up the pressure on stocks, as investors kept a wary eye on developments in the middle east conflict.
the benchmark 10-year yield (^tnx) closed in on reaching 5% for the first time in 16 years, while the 2-year yield — seen as a guide to interest-rate expectations — jumped to its highest since 2006 around 5.24%.
powell's comments on thursday will be scrutinized for signs the fed intends to hike rates again this year, given the us economy is proving resilient. given that, some strategists are questioning whether it's time for the central bank to raise its target for inflation.

"powell says inflation still 'too high,' warns of more rate hikes if economy heats up",2023-10-19T16:00:02.000Z,Jennifer Schonberger,"federal reserve chair jay powell said inflation is still too high and warned that more interest rate increases are still possible if the economy stays surprisingly hot or a tight labor market stops easing.
""additional evidence of persistently above-trend growth, or that tightness in the labor market is no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy,"" powell said in remarks thursday before the economic club of new york.
powell’s comments set the table for the central bank’s next interest-rate setting meeting on nov. 1, coming just days before a 10-day blackout period during which fed officials are not allowed to make any public statements.
the fed at its september meeting held interest rates steady at a 22-year high while signaling another rate hike will be needed later this year to bring inflation back to its 2% target.
investors currently expect the central bank to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at the november meeting, staying in the range of 5.25%-5.50%.
powell made it clear thursday the central bank is closely watching the surge in long-term bond yields, which have risen more than 50 basis points since the fed’s last policy meeting on september 20. other fed officials have said in recent days that if long-term interest rates remain elevated there may be less need for the fed to act.
""we remain attentive to these developments because persistent changes in financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy,"" powell said.
powell said in his speech that while inflation showed progress over the summer, the data from september were somewhat less encouraging.
he acknowledged that shorter-term measures of core inflation — inflation measures that strip out volatile food and energy prices — over the most recent three and six months are now running below 3%.
""but these shorter-term measures are often volatile,"" he said. ""inflation is still too high, and a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.""
the job market, he said, remains strong but is also showing signs of gradually cooling. wage growth, he added, is showing a gradual decline toward levels that would be consistent with 2% inflation over time.
the fed chair emphasized in his speech that the central bank will cautiously walk the line between doing too and doing too little. he noted that given the speed with which the fed has raised rates, there could still be ""meaningful tightening"" in the pipeline.
in recent days and weeks, other fed officials in speeches have urged patience and the need to move cautiously as officials evaluate the direction of the economy and the pace of inflation in determining whether to raise rates again.
“the committee is proceeding carefully,” powell said. ""doing too little could allow above-target inflation to become entrenched and ultimately require monetary policy to wring more persistent inflation from the economy at a high cost to employment. doing too much could also do unnecessary harm to the economy.""

the labor shortage is here for one reason—and it’s quiet quitting,2023-10-14T11:00:00.000Z,Irina Ivanova,"one question has hovered over the post-pandemic economy for the better part of three years: where are all the workers? businesses’ difficulty hiring has been blamed on a gamut of ills: too-generous unemployment benefits; too many stimulus checks; not enough immigration; too many workers with long covid, and, finally, simple laziness.
now, a recent study suggests a different answer: workers are still there—they’re just not working as hard.
three researchers at washington university in st. louis crunched federal data from the census bureau’s current population survey and found that most of the drop in hours worked came from people who stayed employed, but worked fewer hours. their results were published recently in a working paper by the federal reserve bank of st. louis.
“it’s not that fewer people are willing to work—if anything, more people are willing to work than before the pandemic,” co-author yongseok shin, a washington university professor, told fortune. “but it’s that some people are cutting back their hours.”
view this interactive chart on fortune.com
shin and his co-authors, phd candidates dain lee and jinhyeok park, found that 55% of the drop in labor supply since the pandemic was due to a decline in hours, while the rest came from people dropping out of the labor force. and it’s not early retirees who are cutting back, either: most of the reduction came from highly educated men working intensive jobs of 50 hours a week or more, shin said.
“it’s actually young people, 25 to 45, who used to work very long hours, who are now cutting back,” he said, noting, “it’s all men—not women.”
the data helps explain why, even with the labor participation rate near its pre-pandemic level, job openings remain near record highs and hundreds of thousands more jobs are created every month. meanwhile, the unemployment rate is at a mere 3.8%, a rate that was considered unbelievably low a few short years ago.
shin believes the pandemic, which pushed millions of americans to reevaluate what was important to them in life, also set off an epidemic of “quiet quitting,” perhaps better described as salaried workers declining to work excessive hours or hustle quite so much.
“everyone reevaluated their work-life balance, and maybe they said, ‘i don’t have to work 55 hours, i’d like to spend more time with family,’” shin said.
in other words, “quiet quitting,” which has previously been blamed for costing the global economy billions, has also successfully supported the tightest job market in a generation and an increasingly emboldened workforce.
view this interactive chart on fortune.com
crucially, while many of these quiet quitters may have wished for less work pre-pandemic, the advent of hybrid or remote work in white-collar fields has given them the leeway to make it a reality. even in some offices that are calling back their workforces, “no-work fridays” have become a phenomenon, with empty offices, few meetings and significantly fewer emails—something shin said he’s seen among his own friends.
“that’s the technological dimension that allows [workers] to do this,” shin said. “say you’ve done all your work for friday in the morning, and you know your colleagues are not in front of the computer either — this allows people to shift back a little bit and not work when the work is not there.”
less frequently, the cutback in work comes from above—as when shopify earlier this year eliminated unnecessary meetings from its workers’ calendars. “no one schedules meetings for a friday afternoon, or hardly any friday at all. we all agree, ‘let’s get everything done by early afternoon,’” one worker at an advertising agency told the lifestyle publication insidehook.
plenty of corporations are now trying to claw back some of their workers’ newfound free time, whether it’s mandating three days a week in the office, rewarding workers who put in more face time, or simply telling adamant remote workers they can go elsewhere, as amazon ceo andy jassy memorably did this summer.
but if the “new normal” is hybrid work, shin is hopeful that white-collar employees won’t go back to their overworked ways.
he doesn’t see the trend as shirking, but as a realignment of people’s workdays with the vagaries of knowledge jobs. “sometimes you’re just sitting in your office for no obvious reason — it’s not like a production line, where the workflow is constant,” he said.
indeed, “quiet quitting” is a good thing for all parties involved, shin argued, since it brings famously overworked american professionals more closely in line with their peers in europe and other developed nations who take longer vacations and work fewer hours than americans. it’s good for the employer, too, since workers who aren’t burned out can work later in life, if they want to.
while shin’s study only goes through 2022, data from this year shows the trend is sticking, he said. the share of americans who are working has exceeded its pre-pandemic high, but the number of hours worked per person hasn’t budged.
“it seems like this is a collective decision,” he said. “people seem to like it. if this is the new normal, hopefully it can stay.”

toyota and lexus are adopting tesla's ev charging standard,2023-10-20T05:16:55.000Z,Mariella Moon,"one by one, automakers have started adopting the north american charging standard (nacs) used by tesla's superchargers as they move towards their goal of replacing their fleet with electric vehicles. toyota is the latest company to join the growing list. the automaker has announced that it has reached an agreement with tesla to incorporate nacs ports into certain toyota-branded vehicles starting in 2025. some evs under its luxury brand, lexus, will come with the standard's charging ports, as well.
by using nacs ports on its electric vehicles, toyota is effectively giving its customers the power to access more than 12,000 tesla superchargers across north america. while the company won't be implementing the standard over the next year, its timeline matches its rival automakers'. to note, customers who already have toyota and lexus vehicles equipped with the combined charging system (ccs) will be offered access to nacs adapters starting in 2025, as well.
bmw also recently announced that it was adopting the standard for all its evs in the united states and canada. a few months ago, gm and ford revealed they were making the switch starting in 2025, but owners will already be able to access tesla superchargers next year with an adopter. hyundai will adopt the port for its evs in the us in 2024, with evs in canada to follow in 2025. honda, toyota's fellow japanese automaker, announced its transition to nacs in september and its plans to sell vehicles with the port in two years' time. it also said, however, that it's developing an adapter to allow pre-2025 hondas to charge using tesla's system."
how lululemon parlayed yoga pants into an entry to the s&p 500,2023-10-18T17:05:48.000Z,Brooke DiPalma,"lululemon is finally aligning with wall street.
the athleisure retail company officially joined the s&p 500 (^gspc) index on wednesday, replacing game maker activision blizzard (atvi), which recently finalized its merger with microsoft (msft).
the canadian company weathered a series of storms in the mid-2010s but grew out of its yogi-heavy appeal into a cross-generational, multisport brand. in the past year, its stock has risen nearly 40%, while it recently beat estimates on earnings and revenue.
last quarter, its net revenue increased 18% compared to a year ago, while internet sales growth jumped 15%.
""from a long-term perspective, this is a sustainable growth story,"" bernstein senior analyst aneesha sherman told yahoo finance over the phone.
this run-up is a long time coming.
the company, which first started making its signature legging in the late 90s, went public back in 2007. by 2013, its share price had roughly quadrupled, as its revenue flew from $275 million to over $1.3 billion. then, it hit choppy waters.
in march 2013, lululemon recalled 17% of its black yoga pants for being too sheer, which cost it roughly $60 million in lost sales, reported the new york times. its ceo christine day resigned that june, and later told fortune she left due to conflicting views with its founder chip wilson. day declined to comment to yahoo finance.
that november, wilson went on bloomberg tv and said issues with his company's leggings was because ""some women’s bodies don’t work for the pants."" he stepped down from the board a month later amid uproar from customers; lululemon's share price dropped by roughly a quarter in 2014.
day's successor, laurent potdevin, then resigned in 2018, which the company said was due to him falling short of expectations for employees when it comes to integrity and respect. among the issues was a rumored relationship with a female designer at the company.
amid the noise, lululemon marched on, pushing more into menswear in 2014 and investing in digital sales. in august 2018, calvin mcdonald took the helm as ceo and carried forward the momentum as the company moved its appeal beyond yoga.
""since about 2018, it's just been incredibly successful,"" david swartz, morningstar senior equity analyst, told yahoo finance over the phone. ""it's defied all the pressure on retailers, especially apparel retailers in that time.""
as lululemon began its turnaround, athleisure wear kept growing in popularity. in 2017, imports of stretchy pants outpaced those of jeans, according to the us census bureau. 
the company capitalized on the trend at the right time, with a ""premium price point with premium quality that worked with consumers,"" said sherman.
since then, other brands like on running (onon) and hoka have been cashing in on the shift. on running co-ceo martin hoffmann told yahoo finance at the goldman sachs retail conference that ""the trend for casualization is not over,"" but still growing.
multiple generations are buying in, a key growth driver for lululemon.
the company has the ability to appeal to high schoolers alongside its core customer base of 35- to 55-year-olds, sherman said. its leggings are the no. 1 trend among upper-income teens, per piper sandler's latest semiannual gen z survey.
and the previous generation of teens that first grew up with athleisure are entering the workplace. it's now ""perfectly normal"" to wear leggings ""to school, work, and church, and all sorts of [places],"" swartz said, far different than years ago when such attire would be similar to wearing pajamas to your job.
in the past few years, lululemon has been able to ride ""three waves of growth,"" which include e-commerce, athleisure wear booming during covid lockdowns, and pent-up demand for high-quality casual apparel, sherman said.
lululemon's digital sales jumped 27% in fiscal year 2017, hitting a peak jumping 101% year over year in fiscal year 2020. more recently, non-athletic wear like belt bags and men's casual pants are gaining momentum, though it's too early to tell if lululemon can become a universal brand like nike or adidas.
last year, lululemon released its plans to double its 2021 revenue of $6.25 billion to $12.5 billion by 2026. besides expanding its product lines, the company aims to quadruple its international revenue and make china its no. 2 market. the move can unlock wholesale opportunities in the country as well, said sherman.
it also launched its ""play"" categories in 2022, which includes apparel for golf, tennis, and hiking.
growth comes with risks, though. sherman calls the brand's expansion into footwear last year a mistake, as it requires extensive development costs while diluting profit margins. in her eyes, the brand could have pursued other untapped areas like kids. its $500 million acquisition of fitness startup mirror in june 2020 also did not pan out.
though the macroeconomic environment is volatile, lululemon has been able to sell its inventory without taking a discount strategy, mcdonald said at goldman sachs' retail conference earlier this year.
it's undeniable, though: people are increasingly looking for deals as inflation remains sticky and savings dwindle.
""i don't think they [can] escape [consumers looking for discounts],"" said sherman, ""but i think it's probably a little bit more defensive because of the higher-income consumer segment.""

"update 1-white house asks congress for $106 billion for ukraine, israel",2023-10-20T14:54:06.000Z,Reuters,"(adds details of funding)
washington, oct 20 (reuters) - the white house on friday asked congress for nearly $106 billion to fund ambitious plans for ukraine, israel and u.s. border security, but offered no strategy for securing the money from a broken congress.
u.s. president joe biden's request for the funding comes days after he visited israel and pledged solidarity as the country bombards gaza following an attack by hamas militants that killed 1,400 people in southern israel.
by grouping israel funding with ukraine, border security, refugee assistance, measures to counter china and other hotly debated priorities, biden is hoping he has created a must-pass national security spending bill that can win support in a chaotic house of representatives.
the chamber, which republicans won control of last year, has been without a leader for more than two weeks.
some republican lawmakers have grown skeptical of the need to fund ukraine's war with russia, and have threatened to halt government altogether to put an end to debt-fueled fiscal spending.
""the world is watching and the american people rightly expect their leaders to come together and deliver on these priorities,"" said biden's budget director, shalanda young, in a letter to acting house speaker patrick mchenry. ""i urge congress to address them as part of a comprehensive, bipartisan agreement in the weeks ahead.""
in a call with reporters, young said the role of the white house is to lay out the country's needs and the stakes, not to meddle in the speakership battle.
some $14.3 billion of the funding for the 2024 fiscal year would be dedicated to israel, much of it to support the country's air and missile defense systems and other weapons purchases. israel has vowed to wipe out hamas, which rules gaza, after the islamist militant group's oct. 7 attack.
biden also wants more than $9 billion for humanitarian relief, including for israel and gaza, where the population faces a worsening humanitarian crisis.
the proposal also includes $13.6 billion for u.s. border security to deal with large numbers of latin american and caribbean immigrants at the southern border as well as fentanyl trade and $4 billion in military assistance and government financing designed to counter china’s regional efforts in asia.
but the largest share of funding, $61.4 billion, would be for ukraine. the request includes billions to replenish the country's military equipment, providing economy and security aid and support for refugees in the united states.

resilient consumer keeps pressure on fed,2023-10-17T16:59:10.000Z,Josh Schafer,"a hot jobs market is continuing to help boost consumer spending.
retail sales rose 0.7% in september from the previous month, more than double wall street's estimates for 0.3% growth, according to new data from the commerce department released on tuesday. retail sales have now grown from the month prior for six straight months, marking a consistent trend of consumer spending.
this, economists say, has been supported by an average of nearly 270,000 nonfarm payroll additions over the same period. with no clear signs of the labor market fully cooling, the strong position of the us consumer entering the fourth quarter of 2023 could provide upside risks to inflation that's already showing signs of stickiness — and prompt more fed rate hikes.
""the economy is entering q4 with more momentum than we previously thought,"" oxford economics lead us economist michael pearce wrote in a research note on tuesday. ""the risks to our forecast for a slight contraction in consumption in q4 are firmly to the upside. the strength of the economy also means that fed officials will leave the door open for additional rate hikes.""
fed chair jerome powell has noted in the past that a stronger us economy could mean more fed rate hikes to ensure prices fall.
""we’re not looking for a decrease in consumer spending,"" powell said in september. ""it’s a good thing that the economy’s strong ... if the economy comes in stronger than expected, that just means we’ll have to do more in terms of monetary policy to get back to 2% [inflation]—because we will get back to 2%.""
over the past week, fed officials eased market concerns of another interest rate hike as central bankers explained credit tightening caused by rising bond yields could effectively take the place of another fed rate hike. the discussion provided reprieve for bond yields, and stocks rallied.
but that shifted on tuesday with the september retail sales report. markets as of tuesday afternoon are pricing in a roughly 40% chance that the federal reserve hikes interest rates at its december meeting, up from a 25% chance just a week ago, according to the cme fedwatch tool. stocks opened lower after the report, too, while bond yields rose. the 10-year treasury yield breached 4.85%, its highest level in more than a week and just off its 16-year highs.
“today’s strong report along with a recent string of positive economic surprises suggest the economy carried more momentum than previously thought over the summer,"" ey-parthenon senior economist lydia boussour wrote in a research note on tuesday. ""this will keep the federal reserve on high inflation alert, and though it won’t tilt the federal open market committee toward another fed funds rate hike at the november meeting, the december meeting will very much remain a ‘live’ one.""
all eyes on the labor market 
the overall picture for the consumer is still murky. credit card delinquencies have been on the rise, the personal savings rate just hit its lowest level of 2023, and it's still unclear how the return of student loan payments could hurt consumer spending.
""pandemic-related sources of spending like excess savings and easy access to cheap credit are fading, but what this report tells us is that households have grown more comfortable spending at elevated rates,"" wells fargo's senior economist tim quinlan wrote in a research note on tuesday.
and quinlan highlights that willingness to spend might not be going anywhere.
""we have long stressed that real income is the last major driver of spending, and continued labor market tightness suggests income can continue to fuel consumption in the near term,"" quinlan wrote. ""in fact, the only thing that looks to break the back of this consumer would be weakness in the labor market.
but consistent weakness in the labor market isn't apparent at the moment. outside of wages retreating toward pre-pandemic normalcy, the labor market remains robust. the us economy added more jobs in september than it had since january. job openings still remain historically high as the most people look for jobs since before the pandemic. and layoffs have been muted as jobless claims have remained tame.
""we expect the consumer to remain supported in the next couple of quarters as long as the labor market remains strong,"" citi's economics team wrote in a research note on tuesday.
on thursday, powell is expected to provide an update on the economy during a speech at the economic club of new york.

stocks haven’t been this volatile since the regional banking crisis,2023-10-20T15:45:07.000Z,Josh Schafer,"after months of calm trading, volatility has greeted investors over the past week as uncertainty about the fed's plans for interest rates and rising bond yields have weighed on equities.
on thursday, the cboe volatility index (^vix), wall street's favorite gauge for fear and volatility, hit 21 for the first time since a regional banking crisis rocked the stock market in march.
the move came as headwinds have been mounting for investors. geopolitical tensions are rising in the middle east. fears of recession are still proliferating through corporate america. there is uncertainty around leadership in washington and what that could mean for another government shutdown. bond yields are at 16-year highs, and oil prices have been resilient, too.
any one of these factors could weigh on markets. taken together, they've spooked what was once a roaring 2023 market rally.
""as investors navigate vix and bond yields, a defensive tilt is essential,"" evercore isi senior managing director julian emanuel wrote on thursday.
emanuel had drawn a key line in the sand for the vix at 21. below that number, the index could be ""micro-driven"" by things like ai and earnings results. above that level, and the macro factors could take control of the market.
""geopolitical risk (include ukraine/russia and china) is arguably as high as it has been at any time, except 9/11, since before the 1989 fall of the berlin wall,"" emanuel wrote.
but even with all the headwinds weighing on stocks, truist co-chief investment officer keith lerner points out the market story has been more about the rally pausing then a full-blown sell-off, with the s&p 500 down about 3.7% since the federal reserve solidified its higher for longer interest rate stance about a month ago.
""we're using the word crosscurrents right now,"" lerner told yahoo finance live. ""i do think as far as you think about what's happening, the, you know, equity market has been very resilient in spite of everything that's happened here recently.""
recent market action shows the path to a calmer vix is likely rather straightforward. investors want a clearer picture of when the fed will be done hiking rates, which would likely relieve pressure on yields. but unfortunately when that picture will be painted isn't nearly as straightforward.
""the main thing is, as we move towards the end of a fed funds hike cycle, we have to be a patient,"" oppenheimer managing director john stoltzfus, who has a 4900 year-end price target for the s&p 500, told yahoo finance live on friday.

even strong earnings might not be able to save stocks,2023-10-20T09:30:00.000Z,Josh Schafer,"companies are reporting earnings beats on both the top and bottom lines thus far in the third quarter. but it isn't helping the stock market.
all three of the major indexes closed lower on thursday. stocks took a noticeable shift downward after federal reserve chair jerome powell indicated the central bank was doubling down on the fed's ""higher for longer"" stance, sending bond yields to their highs of the day.
the move was emblematic of the market over the past several weeks, which has been almost entirely driven by the ""pain trade"" in bonds.
evercore isi senior managing director julian emanuel believed that earnings could be one of the catalysts for stocks to trade higher. but bond yields have pressed even higher, conflict in the middle east has intensified, and the republican party still hasn't decided on a speaker of the house.
""a tilt toward defensive strategies is becoming necessary,"" emanuel wrote in a new note to clients on thursday.
prior to earnings, emanuel had written that themes like artificial intelligence could benefit companies on the micro level. and, in some cases, individual beats have been rewarded handsomely (see netflix rising more than 16% thursday on its price hikes and subscriber beat). but overall, the cboe volatility index (^vix), wall street's favorite gauge for fear and volatility, is hovering near its highest levels in six months. and that has emanuel concerned.
in emanuel's view, the vix trading near 20 puts the index in a position to be ""micro-driven"" by things like ai and other investment themes. at 21, a level the index rose above on thursday, emanuel says market volatility becomes more driven by macro factors.
""geopolitical risk (include ukraine/russia and china) is arguably as high as it has been at any time, except 9/11, since before the 1989 fall of the berlin wall,"" emanuel wrote.
while earnings can drive individual stocks, the broader market story hasn't changed.
treasury yields remain volatile, while the unknowns around the us economy's trajectory, a boiling geopolitical feud in the middle east, and lack of direction in washington aren't going away. put together, the confluence of pressures isn't a good recipe for markets that typically hate uncertainty.
investors believe volatility in the bond market will end eventually, but a clearer picture of the fed's path forward must come first. throughout a more than 30-minute speech and discussion on thursday, powell didn't spell out if the fed would hike once more or not.
""there wasn't a clear message because he hedged his bets at every turn,"" kevin nicholson, riverfront global fixed income chief investment officer, told yahoo finance live on thursday.
and until that narrative changes, the market regime doesn't appear to be shifting either, even if earnings are beating expectations.

why you shouldn't listen to jamie dimon,2023-10-18T10:00:02.000Z,Julie Hyman,"this is the takeaway from today's morning brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:

economic data releases and earnings
earlier in the week, jamie dimon got our attention by calling this perhaps “the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades.”
and that may be true, from a geopolitical perspective. wars are now raging in both ukraine and israel, with broader implications. dimon also pointed to the risks of the federal reserve’s quantitative tightening program at a time when inflation is persisting.
as my colleague brian sozzi wrote this week, when one of the most powerful ceos in the world makes a dramatic comment like that, you take notice.
but in markets, it’s always a good idea to think about how someone may be talking his book.
“for jamie dimon — for a bank that has strongly outperformed its peers, it’s a matter really of trying to lower expectations,” ken leon, a veteran bank analyst at cfra, told yahoo finance live. “that’s always his mission, to lower the bar, because it’s the one bank every quarter that outperforms and delivers across all the lines of business.” (jpm happens to be one of leon’s top picks).
and if you tune dimon out, there are quite a few reassuring signals.
take tuesday’s retail sales report, which came in double economists’ estimates. while it could put pressure on the fed to raise rates once again, central bank officials have presented a remarkably consistent message over the past couple of weeks: they are willing to be patient, and higher treasury yields are helping tighten financial conditions without them having to further raise rates at this time.
spurred by that retail sales data, the atlanta fed’s gdpnow forecast now stands at 5.4% annualized growth for the third quarter. the s&p 500 has bounced back by more than 3% since early october. early earnings from the big banks and the likes of johnson & johnson have beat estimates.
bank of america’s weekly fund flows data showed an 11th straight week of inflows into equities, with buyers favoring cyclicals over defensives — implying optimism about economic growth.
maybe investors should pay attention to what dimon said after his warning: “while we hope for the best, we prepare the firm for a broad range of outcomes so we can consistently deliver for clients no matter the environment.”
in other words, while there appear to be positive signs for the economy and markets, it never hurts to be prepared for anything.

gas prices are falling even with oil nearing $90 a barrel — here's why,2023-10-17T19:35:39.000Z,Ines Ferré,"us crude oil futures have risen about 5% since the israel-hamas war started earlier this month, but that jump hasn't stopped the downward trend in gasoline prices.
the national average cost of retail gasoline sits at $3.58 per gallon, $0.10 less than a week ago, and $0.30 off from last month, according to aaa data. even california, which has the highest average in the nation at $5.59 per gallon, has seen a $0.17 decline from exactly one week ago.
""gas prices seasonally fall every autumn,"" andrew gross, spokesperson for aaa, told yahoo finance. ""2023 is no exception.""
the main reasons behind the fall decline is the switch to a less expensive winter blend driving fuel and lower seasonal demand.
""gas prices will likely keep dropping until the end of the year,"" gross said. ""the one caveat would be if the new war expands to include oil-producing nations in the region.""
inventories roughly 10% higher than this time one year ago are also pressuring gasoline prices.
the current decline is notable given prices at the pump are about $0.30 lower than a year ago, when oil was hovering around the same levels as today.
""this year is very different from last year, because refined products supply has increased,"" jeff barron, senior petroleum markets analyst at the us energy information administration, told yahoo finance. ""anything that adds product to the market is going to help bring down refinery margins.""
and consumers may continue to enjoy lower prices in the months ahead.
""if current crude prices continue to do the cha-cha, and there are no events (fires, hurricanes, etc.), consumers can expect another 20 to 25 cents per gallon of downside for local gas prices,"" tom kloza, opis global head of energy analysis, told yahoo finance on tuesday.
the us is also witnessing a weaker trend in fuel consumption following a 2023 high in prices reached in mid-september.
""gasoline demand has been weak,"" said the eia's barron. ""depending on which week you’re looking at it’s actually fallen below 2020 levels.""
crude oil prices spiked last week amid fears the israel-hamas war could broaden to other countries — namely iran — a key global oil producer.
despite last week's gains, prices are still roughly 7% below their 2023 high reached on sept. 28.
""fundamentally...the crude market remains very healthy,"" rebecca babin, cibc private wealth energy trader, told yahoo finance live on monday. ""we are in a place where supply and demand are very closely balanced, if not in a slight deficit.""
oil surged in the third quarter of this year amid continued opec+ production cuts and unilateral reductions by saudi arabia, which are expected to continue through year-end.
""a lot of the view [on oil prices] hinges on what [opec+ does] next. i think they stand pat, and we continue to see crude trade really well supported in that low-$80s range,"" babin said.
""[if] we get into the $90s we do start to worry about demand destruction, which i think is a very real thing.""

taylor swift's eras tour film delivers nearly $100 million domestic debut,2023-10-16T17:40:02.000Z,Alexandra Canal,"""taylor swift: the eras tour"" movie debuted at no. 1 at the box office over the weekend, nabbing $92.8 million in domestic ticket sales, according to final estimates released by amc (amc) on monday.
the concert film captured an additional $30.7 million overseas, the theater chain said, making it the best debut of all time for any concert film, in addition to the second-best domestic opening weekend for the month of october following 2019's ""joker.""
adding on to records, the film delivered $13 million globally for imax (imax), resulting in the biggest imax opening ever for a film by a musical artist — concert or documentary.
""it's really kind of an outside-the-box approach to moviegoing right now and something that i think we could see more of going forward,"" shawn robbins, chief analyst at box office pro, told yahoo finance live on monday.
despite the solid showing, amc and cinemark stock (cnk) moved lower in afternoon trading on monday, sinking about 1.5% and 3%, respectively. imax shares traded mostly flat.
the release of the film comes at a critical time for theaters as the nearly five-month-long writers strike caused multiple disruptions to the release schedule. most notably, warner bros.' (wbd) ""dune"" sequel was delayed to march 2024 after it was originally scheduled for november 2023.
other studios have also reshuffled their respective programming slates with hollywood actors still on the picket lines. the union, sag-aftra, accused the alliance of motion picture and television producers (amptp) of ""bullying tactics"" after talks between the two sides broke down over viewership bonuses and regulations surrounding ai.
the amptp bargains on behalf of the major studios including warner bros. (wbd), disney (dis), netflix (nflx), amazon (amzn), apple (aapl), nbcuniversal (cmcsa), paramount (para), and sony (sony).
""this is a weekend theater owners have been very thankful for in the wake of a few delays caused by the writers and actors strikes over recent months,"" robbins said.
""here we are talking about an almost $100 million opening weekend that was basically created out of thin air. this is not something that was on the industry's radar just as recently as the end of summer.""
the film's debut serves as the third-best opening weekend so far this year, behind mattel (mat) and warner bros.' ""barbie"" and disney's ""the little mermaid."" it was also able to edge out universal's ""oppenheimer,"" which delivered just over $82 million in its july debut.
robbins said the film will help the industry achieve its $9 billion domestic box office target by the end of this year. so far, the box office has collected more than $7 billion in sales, according to box office mojo.
and it's not just taylor swift releasing a concert film. a new film about beyoncé’s renaissance world tour will debut in theaters this december — a sign that more concert films could be heading to the big screen.
""taylor has certainly shown what's possible with a concert film when given a true wide release in close to 4,000 theaters, but she's also a hard act to follow,"" the analyst explained.
""we saw a wave of similar films hit cinemas a little over one decade ago. there's no question that they can provide exhibitors with a great source of alternative revenue during slower periods on the hollywood release calendar,"" he continued.

first woman to lead germany’s biggest union takes aim at tesla,2023-10-21T05:00:00.000Z,William Wilkes and Monica Raymunt,"(bloomberg) -- the incoming first female head of germany’s most powerful labor union ig metall is warning elon musk about efforts to avoid unionization at his tesla inc. factory near berlin.

us presses israel to delay gaza invasion to get hostages out
“you need to be careful. the rules of the game are different here,” said christiane benner, who is set to take the helm of the union on monday at its general assembly in frankfurt.
the warning is a shot across the bow for musk, whose factory churns out the popular model y — europe’s best-selling car earlier this year — and has so far refused to sign the kind of wage agreements that are standard in germany, putting the company on a collision course with benner.
ig metall has the power to initiate walkouts at some of germany’s biggest firms, including airbus, siemens, volkswagen and other titans of industry. wage negotiations for its 3.9 million workers are closely watched by european central bank due to their potential impact on inflation.
while tesla’s 12,000-employee plant is a key concern, benner, speaking in an interview with bloomberg news, outlined a broad set of worrying developments putting pressure on germany’s workers.
weaker demand from china, higher interest rates and the lingering fallout from last year’s energy crisis have already caused some factories to close and others to shift production abroad. the economy is forecast to shrink this year. at the same time, the transition to renewable energy and other emerging technologies are requiring workers to have new sets of skills.
“things are very turbulent at the moment,” benner said. “re-qualification is going to be very important.”
read more: german industrial production shrinks for fourth month
ig metall is europe’s biggest manufacturing union, representing workers on automaker assembly lines, steelmaking mills and other factories. the organization takes in about €500 million in annual membership fees and has repeatedly caused stoppages at germany’s most famous firms. with its vast membership, the organization holds considerable political clout.
benner, 55, argues that german politicians have been too slow in tackling the country’s structural issues, putting at risk workers in industries like auto production, which employs roughly 800,000 people.
a growing number of auto-industry workers in and outside of germany are demanding better pay and job security in the shift to electric vehicles. the united auto workers union has launched a major strike targeting general motors, ford and stellantis in the us, halting output at several factories. the concern is that evs, which require fewer moving parts and workers to make, will cost jobs and reduce wages.

in germany, growing voter frustration has fueled the rise of the far-right alternative for germany — known as the afd — which benner sees as a threat to the country’s push to reset its manufacturing base for the green economy. the party, which gained in recent state elections in bavaria and hesse, has objected to technologies such as heat pumps, undermining efforts to attract investors and establish industrial clusters for manufacturing the machines. and its avowedly anti-immigrant position threatens to worsen germany’s longstanding worker shortage.
“people need confidence. they need a plan and they need to see strategies. they need strong unions,” benner said. “we see it as our role to push back against this political fragmentation and polarization.”
her rise at the overwhelmingly male ig metall is remarkable. and alongside volkswagen works council chief daniela cavallo, who is leading the fight against painful cutbacks, it reflects a broader shift in germany’s traditionally male-dominated workers’ leadership.
german rules requires 50% employee representation on the supervisory boards of large corporations — a requirement some have blamed for slow restructuring at troubled firms like volkswagen and thyssenkrupp ag. benner disagrees.
“we can see that when we really push things and present good concepts to companies and governments, good things happen,” benner said.
that’s the message she aims to deliver to tesla, where more than 1,000 staff showed up at the ev-maker’s plant in gruenheide near berlin earlier this month wearing stickers calling for “safe and fair work,” ig metall said. tesla employees are complaining about poor conditions and safety hazards, including extreme workloads due to staff shortages and overly ambitious production targets, according to the union. tesla said the plant has regular checks by local authorities and that safety measures were being respected, according to reuters.

benner hopes to sit down soon with the world’s richest man.

stocks rally to kick off big earnings week: stock market news today,2023-10-16T15:06:01.000Z,Karen Friar,"stocks churned higher during mid-morning trading on monday, building on earlier gains as investors prepared for a host of corporate earnings this week. wall street also braced for heightened geopolitical tensions as the us attempted to advance efforts to contain the israel-hamas conflict.

alongside jpmorgan's results on friday, ceo jamie dimon said this may be ""the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,"" a warning that is still resonating days later.
investors remain focused on the middle east crisis — and right now on whether the us and its allies can stop the clash from drawing in other countries, especially iran. a full-blown regional conflict could send oil prices surging well above $100 a barrel, risking a global recession, some analysts believe.
crude oil futures (cl=f) and brent crude futures (bz=f) traded in a tight range on monday around $87 and $91 a barrel, respectively, after climbing almost 6% on friday.

the bankruptcy is part of an effort to shutter unprofitable stores, address litigation over its role in the opioid pandemic and manage its debt load of roughly $4 billion.
the company said its chapter 11 bankruptcy filing will help resolve the legal claims in an ""equitable manner"" after the department of justice filed a complaint against rite aid in march for its role in the opioid crisis. the complaint alleged rite aid filled ""hundreds of thousands"" of prescriptions that didn't meet legal requirements.
in the filing, rite aid explained that the bankruptcy process will help it walk away from leases at undesirable locations, noting that the company is currently ""burdened"" by unprofitable stores that it can't exit.

"tesla stock sinks 9.3% on profit miss, mexico plant pause; cybertruck deliveries set for nov. 30",2023-10-19T20:35:36.000Z,Pras Subramanian,"tesla stock (tsla) sank 9.3% to its lowest level in nearly two months, after the electric vehicle maker missed on earnings and ceo elon musk's concerns about the global economy, future of its mexico gigafactory, and challenging cybertruck ramp-up weighed on shares.
for the third quarter, tesla reported top-line revenue of $23.4 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $24.06 billion; however, revenue did climb 13% from a year ago. from a profitability standpoint, tesla reported adjusted earnings per share (eps) of $0.66 versus $0.74 expected and adjusted net income of $2.3 billion versus $2.56 billion expected.
the drop in profitability could be attributed to expected downward pressure on margins since tesla began its cost-cutting efforts late last year. tesla reported a q3 gross margin of 17.9%, slightly missing wall street estimates of 18.0%. last quarter tesla reported a gross margin of 18.2%.
""the quarter itself delivered auto [gross margin] (ex credits) of 16.3% vs. the street at 17.6% with margins that should stabilize over the coming quarters however tesla is not committing to the end of price cuts and that is a big problem and overhang for the stock in the near-term,"" wedbush analyst dan ives wrote in a note published thursday morning. wedbush lowered its tesla price target to $310 from $350 following q3 earnings.
looking ahead to future products, tesla revealed cybertruck deliveries remain on track for later this year, with deliveries beginning on nov. 30. on the conference call, musk said it would take a year to 18 months before the cybertruck would be cash-flow positive and that by 2025 he expected a production run rate of 250,000 units a year. musk added that tesla would face ""enormous challenges"" in reaching volume production of the cybertruck.
""we believe the 3q report will add to near-to-intermediate term investor concerns given company commentary that the current macro backdrop/higher rates could gate its growth (including how quickly it ramps factories), and comments that the initial cybertruck ramp could be slow,"" goldman sachs analyst mark delaney wrote in a note to investors. delaney subsequently lowered his tesla price target to $235 from $265 following the q3 report.
tesla, however, did reiterate its 2023 production goal of 1.8 million vehicles. earlier this month, tesla said it delivered 435,059 vehicles globally, of which approximately 419,000 were model y and model 3 vehicles and around 16,000 were higher-priced model x and model s cars. wall street consensus estimates had deliveries pegged at 456,722.
through three quarters of the year, tesla has delivered around 1.3 million vehicles globally, so the company will need a very strong quarter — of around 500,000 deliveries — to hit its annual delivery goal. tesla did project that it expects model y production to gradually ramp up higher at giga austin and giga berlin.
also, ceo elon musk noted on the conference call that while tesla is laying the groundwork to begin construction on giga mexico, he wanted to get a sense first of global economic conditions before going ""full tilt"" on the build-out. musk raised concerns about the rising interest rate environment as an impediment to growth but said tesla will eventually build the factory in mexico when questioned about the project's future.
cfra analyst garrett nelson had a more upbeat take on tesla's prospects following its q3 earnings report.
""despite the miss, tsla reiterated 2023 volume guidance of 1.8m units and said that while the cybertruck is in pilot production, its annual installed cybertruck production capacity is now in excess of 125k units, which we think should reassure investors concerned about the ramp-up of the highly-anticipated new model,"" nelson wrote in a note, reiterating his buy rating for tesla, though shaving his price target by $10 to $300 a share.
""we also view investor concerns regarding recent gross margin pressures as somewhat overblown, as comps should improve in the next couple of quarters,"" nelson said while adding that tesla will emerge from the ongoing united auto workers strike with an ""even wider competitive moat"" as the industry's biggest winner in the ev race.

"tesla, netflix, and banks highlight earnings rush: the week ahead",2023-10-15T14:00:03.000Z,Josh Schafer,"after weeks of fed speak and rising yields driving stock action, corporate earnings will take center stage in the week ahead.
results from bank of america (bac) and goldman sachs (gs) will provide a look at how the financial sector is responding to the rising rate environment. meanwhile, tesla and netflix will highlight the start of tech earnings.
a september retail sales report is expected to show minor growth amid an otherwise quiet week for economic data.
recent economic data showed inflation cooling enough for the market to bet that the fed won't raise interest rates at its november meeting but stocks still struggled to find solid footing as rising geopolitical risks and the fallout from higher for longer interest rates continue to cloud the picture.
in the past week, the nasdaq (^ixic) fell nearly 0.2% while the benchmark s&p 500 (^gspc) rose almost 0.5% and the dow jones industrial average (^dji) popped about 0.8%.
inflation data out last week showed cooling price increases under the surface. the data left markets optimistic on a rate pause in november as fed officials expressed that higher yields could provide necessary monetary tightening and effectively take the place of another interest rate hike.
but combined with a hot september jobs report, there isn't a broad consensus that the fed is done hiking altogether.
""continued strength in the labor market could lead to persistence in wage growth and forestall declines in consumption growth, which would leave price pressures elevated and growth above trend,"" oxford economics' team of economists wrote in a research note on thursday. ""with the fed committed to returning inflation back to its long-run target of 2%, this would raise the odds of rate increases this year, extend the duration of restrictive monetary policy, and increase the chances of a recession occurring down the road.""
the impact of the federal reserve's interest rate hikes on corporate america are expected to once again be a key focus during third quarters earnings season. and at first reading, major financial institutions are holding up, as jpmorgan chase (jpm), citigroup (c), and wells fargo (wfc) all reported higher profits during earnings releases on friday.
but jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon laid out risks ahead in the company's earnings release.
""us consumers and businesses generally remain healthy, although consumers are spending down their excess cash buffers,"" dimon said before commenting on how rising geopolitical tensions in the middle east could further cloud the economic picture.
""the war in ukraine compounded by last week’s attacks on israel may have far-reaching impacts on energy and food markets, global trade, and geopolitical relationships,"" dimon continued. ""this may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades.""
in the week ahead, bank of america, goldman sachs, and morgan stanley (ms) will lead the earnings calendar for the financial sector.
""the disappointing thing is jpmorgan was the best last quarter and probably will be the best in terms of performance this quarter,"" dave ellison, hennessy financial funds manager, told yahoo finance live after jpmorgan reported results. ""so we're getting the best of bank earnings today and the rest is going to be not quite as exciting.""
tesla recently missed wall street's estimates for third quarter deliveries, and margins remain a key concern for the electric vehicle maker. margins have declined throughout 2023 as the company has used price cuts to ignite demand. 
morgan stanley equity analyst adam jonas thinks margins likely fell to 17.5% from 18.2% in the period prior. after hosting a ""bull/bear lunch"" this week, jonas said the read on tesla's earnings ""skews cautious.""
""many are wondering if tesla can grow earnings at all in fiscal year '24,"" jonas wrote in a research note on oct. 11.
he added: ""the performance of tesla stock following the print will likely be driven by comments on the forward outlook and how that may move consensus (up/down/neutral) for [fiscal year] '24.""
for netflix, investors will be searching for details on recent developments at the company including rumors of a price hike, new details on the streamer's password sharing crackdown, and the success of the advertising tier.
""we believe pricing changes, slower than expected sub growth, anecdotal consumer checks, and viewership data indicate netflix has slowed down, if not outright stopped, cracking down on password sharing,"" jefferies equity analyst andrew uerkwitz wrote in a research note previewing earnings. ""this is likely due to re-focusing on getting timing, content, and pricing structures in a better position to increase borrower retention. we adjust our revenue model lower on new subscriber growth.""
in sum, uerkwitz is ""looking for earnings to provide some answers.""
broadly, the question facing investors this earnings season will be if company results can bring stocks out of their recent slump. entering third quarter reports, the street projected flat earnings compared to the same period a year prior.
some strategists believe the stronger-than-expected data could drive better-than-feared earnings. if that's the case, the next catalyst for stocks could take hold.
""we expect a better-than-feared earnings season and the spx trading toward the top end of our range (4200-4600),"" wells fargo equity analyst christopher harvey wrote in a note to clients on friday.
but the ""upside will be hampered by interest rates,"" he added.

lenders can count 75% of estimated rental income from accessory dwelling units, or adus, as qualifying income when underwriting a mortgage backed by the federal housing administration, the us department of housing and urban development announced this week. the new provision also allows 50% of the estimated rental income for a to-be-built adu to qualify for a mortgage under the fha’s renovation home loan.

the fha defines an adu as a unit that has a separate entrance and meets all requirements for habitation. an adu can be in addition to, part of, or detached from the primary residence.
the aim of the new rules is to help ease the national housing shortage crisis by creating more supply through private owners. it also seeks to help new buyers and existing homeowners create more housing equity by providing financing for adus.
""with our new adu policy, we’ll help households of more modest means maximize the potential benefits of homeownership to build wealth,"" julia gordon, assistant secretary for housing, said in a statement. ""this new policy also contributes to the supply of affordable housing in many neighborhoods where it’s most needed and least available.""
the us currently needs 6.5 million more housing units to accommodate its growing households, according to realtor.com. the gap occurred in the last decade when 15.6 million households were formed but only 9.03 million new single-family homes were developed. that gap shrinks to 2.3 million if counting multi-family developments developed during the period, but still remains large.
as a result of the shortage, the rental vacancy rate dropped to its lowest level since 2000 to 5.6% in fourth quarter of 2021 and again in the second quarter of 2022, according to realtor.com. rents also have been rising. the national median rent jumped by 22% in five years between 2016 and 2021.
""for many americans, an affordable home is harder than ever to come by,"" emily hamilton, senior research fellow at mercatus center at the george mason university, wrote in an opinion column. ""adus — small rental units that can be added to existing properties and ease housing shortages — are at the forefront of these efforts. from an affordability perspective, adus are an attractive reform option because these units can rent for hundreds of dollars less than apartments in the same neighborhood.""
adus are on the rise. nearly 1.4 million units throughout the nation were identified by freddie mac in 2019. the number of adus in the us also grew on an average of 8.6% year over year from 2009 to 2019, according to the data.
the share of adus available in active listings also grew to 6.8% in 2019 from 1.6% in 2000, the data found. the gain is also reflected in homes sold; nearly 70,000 sold homes came with adu in 2019, about 6.7 times more than 2000, the data shows.
the majority of adus in the nation are located in areas that are experiencing major rent growth. for instance, california, florida, texas, and georgia account for half of the 1.4 million adus identified by freddie mac, and three of those states — california, florida, and texas — all saw their median rents rise faster than the national average in the last two years, according to tracking by ipropertymanagement.
""these desirable areas have all been losing residents in recent years—in large part due to the lack of affordable housing options,"" scott wild, senior vice president of consulting at john burns, a us housing research and consulting firm, wrote about california and the rise of adus. ""land is in short supply, and building new neighborhoods is a long and challenging process.""
lenders always review an applicant's debt-to-income, or dti, ratio to determine the individual's risk and ability to pay back a loan when underwriting a mortgage.
the new rule that lets mortgage underwriters include estimated adu rental income lowers a borrower's dti ratio by increasing the income portion of the equation, giving them a stronger borrowing stance.
the extra income qualifier can significantly help owners finance for adus as units around 600 square feet bring in between $1,600 to $2,500 monthly rents in major cities, according to maxable, which offers guides for homeowners on planning, hiring, and managing an adu.
""the income component is going to help with qualifying,"" jason mata, a mortgage professional with american pacific mortgage, told yahoo finance. ""it's going to give them more capacity to be able to borrow.""
that's especially helpful now with mortgage rates rising toward 8% and borrowers are facing affordability challenges.

""new buyers that are ready to endure these rates, these changes could help them get a little bit more buying capacity,"" mata said. ""they are just trying to create affordability.""

wall street's 'magnificent seven' face moment of truth as earnings season arrives,2023-10-19T14:27:05.000Z,Lewis Krauskopf,"by lewis krauskopf
new york (reuters) - high noon is approaching for the market's biggest stocks, as pressure grows on richly valued technology and growth companies to deliver robust earnings at a time when sky-high bond yields threaten to dull the allure of equities.
huge rallies for the so-called ""magnificent seven"" stocks – apple, microsoft, alphabet, amazon, nvidia, tesla and meta platforms – have driven nearly all of the s&p 500’s 12% year-to-gain because of their outsized weighting in the index.
that stellar performance has also raised the stakes in the upcoming earnings season. valuations have swelled, with the magnificent seven trading at an average forward price-to-earnings ratio of 33.5, compared with the s&p 500's p/e of 18.3.
at the same time, treasury yields at 16-year highs are providing investment competition to stocks. with u.s. government bonds now offering risk-free yields of around 5% or more, investors may be less forgiving of companies which are unable to deliver strong results.
that appeared to be the case for tesla, the first of the megacaps to report results this period. shares of tesla were down 7% on thursday morning after the electric vehicle maker missed wall street estimates on third-quarter gross margin, profit and revenue.
“everybody knows these guys are going to make money,"" said sameer samana, senior global market strategist at the wells fargo investment institute (wfii), referring to the magnificent seven. ""the only question is how fast is that earnings growth, and have investors overpaid for it.""
the wells fargo investment institute in june downgraded its rating on the information technology sector — which includes apple, microsoft and nvidia — to ""neutral"" from ""favorable.”
results from microsoft, google-parent alphabet, amazon and facebook-parent meta are expected next week, while apple and nvidia are set to report next month.
in aggregate, the megacap companies are expected to post a 32.8% gain in earnings in 2023, while the rest of the s&p 500 sees a 2.3% decline, according to tajinder dhillon, senior research analyst at lseg.
complicating the outlook is the relentless climb in interest rates and treasury yields, which has been driven by a mix of federal reserve hawkishness in the face of a strong economy and worries over the u.s. fiscal picture.
growth and tech companies are seen as being more vulnerable to higher yields, as their typically robust projected future cash flows are valued less highly when investors can earn more from risk-free government bonds.
the yield on the benchmark 10-year treasury recently stood at 4.94%, its highest since july 2007.
“people have got choices that they didn’t have and they will allocate differently,"" said tim pagliara, chairman and chief investment officer at capwealth. ""the reallocation of funds going forward is going to suggest lower returns and more difficulty for the magnificent seven to maintain their leadership.""
capwealth holds microsoft shares and below-benchmark positions in apple and amazon, pagliara said.
tesla ceo elon musk said on wednesday that he was concerned about the impact of high interest rates on car buyers.
the megacaps' outperformance this year means their market heft has also grown. the seven companies' combined market capitalization topped 30% of the s&p 500's overall market value earlier this month, according to lseg datastream.
more than a third of fund managers named ""long big tech"" as the most crowded trade, according to bofa global research's monthly survey published this week.
""returns this year in the s&p 500 have been driven entirely by returns in the seven biggest stocks, and these seven stocks have become more and more overvalued,"" torsten slok, chief economist at apollo global management, said in a note.
of course, betting against the market’s champions has proven an unprofitable endeavor. the 10-stock nyse fang+ index, which includes the magnificent seven, has gained 140% since the end of 2019 before the pandemic, versus a 33% gain for the s&p 500.
some investors are also drawing distinctions among the seven stocks. brandywine global holds shares of alphabet and meta, which generate significant cash and are cheaper than megacap peers, said patrick kaser, a portfolio manager at the investment firm.
""they are all growth stories,"" kaser said. ""but where that growth comes from, how steady it is supposed to be, and how much is in their control, really differs a lot among the seven.""

"us budget gap soars to $1.7 trillion, largest outside covid era",2023-10-20T20:03:47.000Z,David Lawder,"by david lawder
washington (reuters) -the u.s. government on friday posted a $1.695 trillion budget deficit in fiscal 2023, a 23% jump from the prior year as revenues fell and outlays for social security, medicare and record-high interest costs on the federal debt rose.
the treasury department said the deficit was the largest since a covid-fueled $2.78 trillion gap in 2021. it marks a major return to ballooning deficits after back-to-back declines during president joe biden's first two years in office.
the deficit comes as biden is asking congress for $100 billion in new foreign aid and security spending, including $60 billion for ukraine and $14 billion for israel, along with funding for u.s. border security and the indo-pacific region.
the big deficit, which exceeded all pre-covid deficits, including those brought about by republican tax cuts passed under donald trump and from the financial crisis years, is likely to enflame biden's fiscal battles with republicans in the house of representatives, whose demands for spending cuts pushed the u.s. to the brink of default in early june over the debt ceiling.
a deal to avoid a government shutdown over deeper spending cut demands from republican hardliners led to the ouster of u.s. house of representatives speaker kevin mccarthy, and the party is still divided over who should lead them, which is expected to make negotiations ahead of a new fiscal deadline in mid-november more difficult.
for september, the final month of the fiscal year, the deficit fell to $171 billion from $430 billion in september 2022.
""falling revenues are a significant contributor to the 2023 deficit, underscoring the importance of president biden's enacted and proposed policies to reform the tax system,"" treasury secretary janet yellen and office of management and budget director shalanda young said in a joint statement.
the fiscal 2023 deficit would have been $321 billion larger, but was reduced by this amount because the supreme court struck down biden's student loan forgiveness program as unconstitutional. the ruling forced the treasury to reverse a pre-emptive charge against fiscal 2022 budget results that increased that year's deficit.
the fiscal year 2022 deficit was $1.375 trillion.
taking into account the two one-off adjustments, last fiscal year's deficit would have been closer to $1 trillion and this year's closer to $2 trillion, a treasury official said.
record interest costs
the 2023 deficit marks an abrupt end to two years of falling deficits for biden as covid-19 spending faded. the u.s. deficit peaked in fiscal 2020 at $3.13 trillion as the sharpest downturn since the 1930s severely constrained tax revenues while spending on unemployment benefits, direct payments to consumers and aid to businesses peaked.
but the congressional budget office has warned that based on current tax and spending legislation, u.s. deficits will approach covid-era levels by the end of the decade, reaching some $2.13 trillion in 2030 as interest, health and pension costs mount.
for the 2023 fiscal year, total revenues fell $457 billion, or 9% from fiscal 2022, to $4.439 trillion, largely due to a drop in non-withheld individual income tax payments amid a worse performance in stocks and other financial assets as interest rates rose.
other revenue declines included a $106 billion drop in federal reserve earnings as interest paid on bank reserves ate up any portfolio income.
fiscal 2023 outlays fell $137 billion, or 2% from the prior year to $6.134 trillion. outlays would have been more modest were it not for large increases in spending on retirement and healthcare benefits for the elderly and in debt service costs.
social security spending rose 10% to $1.416 trillion due to cost of living adjustments for inflation, and spending for the medicare senior healthcare program rose 4% to $1.022 trillion.
interest costs on the more than $33 trillion in federal debt also rose sharply, up 23% to $879 billion, a record. net interest payments, excluding intragovernmental transfers to trust funds, rose 39% to $659 billion, also a record, according to a treasury official.
gross interest payments amounted to 3.28% as a share of gross domestic product, the highest since 2001, and the net share at 2.45% was the highest since 1998, the official said.
interest rates have soared over the last year and a half as the federal reserve jacked up borrowing costs to slow inflation. the average interest cost on the treasury's outstanding debt was 2.97% last fiscal year, up from 2.07% the year before.

"fed has 'wrong inflation target,' should be less data dependent, el-erian says",2023-10-19T15:24:02.000Z,Hamza Shaban,"the dependence on economic data that has been a guiding light of jerome powell's tenure at the federal reserve is also one of its great weaknesses, said mohamed el-erian in a new interview with yahoo finance's julie hyman on thursday.
in critical remarks of the us central bank, the president of queens' college, cambridge, and chief economic adviser at allianz, said that powell's emphasis on backward-looking data, which operates with a lag, has denied the economy and market observers the clarity and vision that were present under previous eras of the fed.
el-erian pointed to the sharp rise in treasury yields as a cause for concern.
in addition to the higher borrowing costs for both households and businesses and the drag on the economy, he emphasized the abrupt climb of yields. ""there's fear, and i hope it's just a fear, that this could break something.""
treasury yields have continued their march higher, with the 10-year treasury reaching 4.9% for the first time since 2007 in a move that has dragged the stock market lower. as investors sell bonds, prices fall and yields rise. and as this year's sell-off in the bond market deepens, yahoo finance's jared blikre reports, there's increasing worry that an approach towards a big, round number like 5% for 10-year yields can serve as a psychological magnet for investors, lifting yields even higher.
for el-erian, fed policy is no longer an anchor. ""it's too backward-looking,"" he said. ""so this is really a hard time for the bond market. and we need stability. we desperately need stability.""
powell said thursday that the fed would proceed ""carefully"" with its next steps. el-erian said he'd like the fed chair to pull back from an approach that is ""excessively data-dependent."" instead, he'd like powell to recognize that ""you cannot drive a car on a curvy road looking through the back-view mirror,"" he said.
el-erian continued: ""that's what data dependency does. when your fed tools operate with lags, it becomes a problem at points of inflections.""
contrasting powell's leadership style with former fed chairs janet yellen (now the current treasury decretary), ben bernanke, and alan greenspan, el-erian said ""this is the first fed that hasn't got a single strategic bone in it.""
the fed's inflation goal of 2%, which has proven to be an elusive figure for central bankers, also drew el-erian's criticism. ""we have the wrong inflation target,"" he said.
""even if you abstract from all the problems, the deep hole that the fed dug itself into, we have these genuine uncertainties about monetary policy going forward.""

only 2 major automakers haven’t adopted tesla’s ev charging standard,2023-10-20T20:42:12.000Z,Ben Munson,"tesla’s (tsla) north american charging standard (nacs) has steadily won over nearly every automaker and this week saw two more dominoes fall.
both toyota (including lexus) and bmw (including mini and rolls-royce) this week announced their plans to adopt nacs. toyota will incorporate nacs ports into certain toyota and lexus battery electric vehicles starting in 2025, and it will offer nacs adapters to customers with evs relying on the combined charging system (ccs). bmw announced almost identical plans.
with both toyota and bmw pledging to adopt nacs, that leaves stellantis and volkswagen as two of the only major automakers still holding out. general motors, ford, honda, nissan, hyundai, volvo, mercedes-benz, rivian, polestar, fisker and more have already announced plans to build evs that can tap into tesla’s massive global network of more than 50,000 superchargers.

in june, after the other two big u.s. automakers rolled out plans for nacs, stellantis told reuters it was still evaluating the standard.
""our focus is to provide the customer the best charging experience possible. our free2move charge brand will offer seamless, simple solutions whether at home or on-the-go through partnerships with charging providers,"" the company said in a statement.
in july, volkswagen also suggested it was open to shifting toward tesla’s charging standard after electric america, the charging network it owns, announced it will add nacs charging stations by 2025.
“we welcome access to additional charging infrastructure for our north american customers and always aim for improving the charging experience via open standards and seamless interoperability,” the company said in a statement.
with all the momentum behind nacs, it could only be a matter of time before stellantis and volkswagen jump on the bandwagon."
billionaire investor leon cooperman says the s&p 500 won't hit a new high for years – and house prices will probably fall,2023-10-20T22:22:04.000Z,Theron Mohamed,"leon cooperman told insider in an interview he thought stocks were overvalued.
the billionaire investor said he didn't expect the s&p 500 to hit a fresh high for a long time.
cooperman said a ""rolling correction"" was underway and house prices were likely to drop.
leon cooperman said stocks were overpriced, and the s&p 500 wouldn't notch a fresh high for a very long time.
""i made my money being a bull, but i find myself somewhat pessimistic at the present time,"" the billionaire investor and philanthropist told insider in an interview this week.
more than a decade of near-zero interest rates and gratuitous government spending have ""pulled forward demand in a dramatic way,"" driving up asset prices and running up the national debt, he said. ""ultimately, the piper has to be paid.""
but cooperman isn't quite as bearish as other market gurus such as jeremy grantham and john hussman.
""i don't think we're in a bubble; i think we're in a rolling correction,"" he said before adding that it would probably ""take a long time for us to work out the problems.""
cooperman predicted that the s&p 500 — which has returned at least 12% in five of the last seven years — would underperform for the next few years and not surpass its current record of about 4,800 points for a long while.
he said buying an index fund wouldn't be a winning strategy, and investing would be more of a stock picker's game.
the former boss of goldman sachs' asset management arm, who converted his omega advisors hedge fund into a family office in 2018, pointed out there had already been a bear market in the vast majority of stocks.
a handful of big tech names, including tesla, nvidia, and microsoft, have pulled the major indexes higher this year, but excluding the so-called magnificent seven, stocks are virtually flat.
cooperman also touched on the housing market, which saw prices jump by more than 5% to a record high in the first seven months of this year despite mortgage rates surging to multi-year highs.
home values have been shored up by a decadeslong shortfall in the number of new homes built each year. prospective sellers have also balked at listing their homes and taking on a new mortgage when 30-year rates are about 8%, compared with about 3% at the start of 2022.
the veteran investor said he expected home prices to fall due to the current affordability crisis. many buyers aren't willing or able to pay top dollar for their next home and take on a painfully high monthly mortgage payment.
cooperman, who recently published a memoir titled ""from the bronx to wall street: my fifty years in finance and philanthropy,"" has sounded the alarm on stocks a few times this year.
he said in february that the s&p 500 was likely to bottom around 3,100 points, or 35% below its january 2022 peak. and he said in june that nvidia stock surging by about 200% this year was ""not going to end well.""

"these 12%-plus dividend stocks look very attractive right now, analysts say",2023-10-20T14:06:21.000Z,TipRanks,"year-to-date, markets are up – some 12% for the s&p 500, and 28% for the nasdaq, even after recent volatility and pullbacks. but there’s worry in the air, and the red flags are flying. a combination of persistently high inflation and interest rates, along with an increasingly dangerous geopolitical situation, has more and more experts calling out warnings.
on the domestic policy side, federal reserve chairman jerome powell said in recent comments, “inflation is still too high, and a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.” he went on to add that monetary policy is not too tight, a clear indication that the fed will maintain high interest rates.
meanwhile, jamie dimon, ceo of jpmorgan, has sounded a stern warning on the geopolitical front. he’s closely monitoring ongoing conflicts, such as ukraine and russia, intensifying tensions like those between israel and hamas, and china’s assertive posturing regarding taiwan. dimon says, “my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there,” and he closes by reminding us, “this may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades.”
the confluence of risks should rekindle interest in strong defensive plays, particularly high-yield dividend stocks. these stocks offer both protection and passive income during these challenging times.
wall street analysts seem to concur, as they have identified high-yield dividend payers as attractive buys right now. let’s delve into two of these picks: buy-rated stocks with at least 12% dividend yields.
hercules capital (htgc)
let’s start with hercules capital, a unique business development company (bdc). what sets hercules apart is its specialized focus on emerging companies. instead of following the traditional bdc model, hercules primarily offers venture debt, providing pre-ipo firms with an attractive alternative to traditional venture capital for funding and financing.
hercules has been successful in this niche, and over the years has compiled an impressive set of statistics. since its inception, this bdc has funded more than 600 companies, to the tune of more than $17 billion. in the last reported quarter, 2q23, hercules made $541.5 million in new debt and equity commitments and had $4 billion in assets under management.
the company’s second quarter results showed several other strong metrics. at the top line, hercules reported a total investment income of $116.2 million and a net investment income of $75.7 million. both of these were company quarterly records, and the total investment income was up 61% year-over-year while beating the forecast by $7.5 million. at the bottom line, hercules’ nii per share, at 53 cents, exceeded expectations by 4 cents per share.
hercules has seen rising revenues and income over the past several quarters and has been increasing the dividend in response. the company pays both a regular quarterly and a supplemental common share dividend. the last declaration, made in august of this year and paid on august 25th, included a regular dividend of 40 cents per share, which was up 2.6% from the prior quarter, along with a supplemental payment of 8 cents per share. the regular dividend yields 10%, and when combined with the supplemental payment, the total yield is 12.1%.
for jmp analyst devin ryan, who holds a 5-star rating from tipranks, hercules presents investors with an all-around solid opportunity. he writes, “given hercules’ position as the leading platform and impressive long-term track record within venture lending, we expect ongoing equity market volatility will continue to drive strong demand for debt solutions (coupled with broader trends within the banking sector – i.e., banks pulling back on lending, etc.), ultimately positioning the company even better longer term.”
looking ahead at that longer term, ryan gives htgc shares an outperform (i.e. buy) rating, and an $18 price target implies a one-year upside potential of 13.5%. add in the dividend yield, and this stock’s one-year return can reach 25% or more. (to watch ryan’s track record, click here)
overall, there is a moderate buy consensus rating on htgc shares, based on 6 recent analyst reviews with a breakdown of 4 buys and 2 holds. the stock’s $15.77 trading price and $17.42 average target price suggest an upside of 10.5% in the next 12 months. (see htgc stock forecast)
trinity capital (trin)
next on our list of high-yielding dividend payers is trinity capital, another bdc. trinity, like hercules, works in the venture debt segment. the company’s portfolio strategy is based on developing current income and capital appreciation through its combination of debt and equipment financings, along with equity-related investments and working capital loans.
by the numbers, trinity has made 298 investments since its founding. through the end of this year’s second quarter, the company’s fundings have totaled $2.6 billion, and trinity currently has $1.2 billion in assets under management. the company’s portfolio currently includes investments in aviation and aerospace, energy and hardware, information technology and services, and life sciences.
digging into trinity’s most recent reported quarter, 2q23, we find that the company beat expectations on both revenues and earnings. on its top line, trinity’s revenue, reported as total investment income, was $46 million; this was $4.7 million ahead of the estimates, and up more than 37% year-over-year. the firm’s bottom-line net investment income came to 61 cents per share, 9 cents better than the forecast.
these results supported trinity’s strong dividend, which was last set on september 13. the common share payment included both a regular and supplemental dividend, with the combination totaling $0.54 per share. at an annualized rate of $2.16 per common share, the combined dividend yields nearly 16%.
the combination of profitable growth and solid dividends caught the attention of 5-star analyst casey alexander, from compass point. alexander writes of trinity, “we expect incremental growth will come from increasing fees and income from the trinity jv. we see a continuance of dividend increases as trin has a nice buffer between the earnings power and the current dividend. in the meantime, trin’s legacy portfolio has to navigate the vc cycle without further distress. given the pullback in trin share price and the accretive equity offering, we now judge the risk reward as favorable…”
alexander goes on to give trinity’s stock a buy rating along with a $15.50 price target that points toward a gain, over the next 12 months, of ~15%. together with  the dividend, the return here can exceed 30%. (to watch alexander’s track record, click here)

predictions for the size of prescription weight loss drugs keep growing.
new research from goldman sachs projects 15 million adults in the us will be on anti-obesity medications by 2030, representing 13% penetration in the us adult population—not including diabetic patients.
globally, goldman sachs sees sales for chronic weight management reaching $100 billion by 2030, up from a $6 billion annualized estimate earlier this year.
""the chronic weight management market is undergoing an inflection, in our view, with potential for solid growth ahead and a peak opportunity that, by our estimates, could ultimately yield some of the highest grossing drugs of all time,"" a team of goldman sachs analysts led by chris shibutani wrote in a research note on monday.
recent buzz about the impact of the weigh-loss drugs has caught the attention of wall street. several analysts have questioned whether drugs like ozempic could hamper demand for fast food—and food sales at retailers like walmart, (wmt) which has said the drug was leading to lower revenue.
the excitement has driven stock gains for prescription drugs producers, novo nordisk (nvo) and eli lily (lly). last week, novo nordisk raised his its full-year sales guidance on a better-than-expected sales outlook from its diabetes drug, ozempic. the drug isn't approved directly for weight loss, but it's still become a popular use for the drug. meanwhile during its most recent quarterly earnings report in august, eli lily raised its own sales guidance on increased demand for its type-2 diabetes management drug, mounjaro.

netflix (nflx) is set to report its fiscal third quarter earnings on wednesday after the market closes. investors are looking for updates on the company's crackdown on password sharing, ad-supported offerings, and the potential for more price hikes.
netflix, which has faced recent wall street downgrades, disappointed investors in the second quarter after revenue fell short of estimates and the company's q3 forecast came in lighter than expected.
the revenue lag reflects the fact that the company's advertising tier has yet to fully materialize — threatening its goal of double-digit revenue growth.
""we're still in the crawl of the crawl-walk-run stage, so it is not easy to build an ad business from scratch. we got a lot of work to do,"" netflix cfo spencer neumann said about the ad tier last month.
the company had also reported lower-than-expected arm, or average revenue per membership; it forecasted that arm will be flat to slightly down in q3 compared to the same period in 2022. that's despite an expected 6 million boost of new subscribers in the third quarter amid the password crackdown.
here's what wall street expects, according to bloomberg consensus estimates:
revenue: $8.53 billion
adjusted earnings per share (eps): $3.56
subscribers: 6.2 million net additions

stocks are once again trading in negative territory after the major indices initially reversed earlier losses.
in late afternoon trading, the dow jones industrial average (^dji) shed 0.2%, or more than 75 points. the benchmark s&p 500 (^gspc) dipped about 0.3% while contracts on the tech-heavy nasdaq 100 (^ndx) were down roughly 0.4%.
treasury yields, however, continued to soar. the yield on the benchmark 10-year treasury (^tnx) jumped about 14 basis points to trade around 4.86%. the 10-year yield hit a 16-year high of 4.89% on oct. 6.
oil prices steadied following news that president joe biden will visit israel on wednesday. crude oil (cl=f) settled above $86 a barrel, while brent crude (bz=f) settled at just under $90 a barrel.
here are some of the stocks leading yahoo finance’s trending tickers page in afternoon trading on tuesday: 
nvidia (nvda): shares of the chipmaker somewhat steadied from earlier losses, but were still down about 3.5% after the biden administration increased its restrictions around the sale of semiconductors from american companies to china. other stocks like advanced micro devices (amd) and vmware (vmw) also fell on the news, down roughly 1% and 6%, respectively.
bank of america (bac), goldman (gs): shares of big banks bank of america and goldman sachs moved in opposite directions on tuesday following a mixed bag of earnings. bank of america rose about 3% after the company reported a boost in q3 profits, while goldman sank more than 1% as q3 profits fell. 
johnson and johnson (jnj): shares traded flat despite the company reporting a third quarter beat on both the top and bottom lines on tuesday, in addition to raising its full-year guidance. the report was the company's first earnings release since spinning off its consumer health business, kenvue (kvue).
general motors (gm): shares were flat after the company revealed it will delay its ev production plan, which includes the conversion of its orion assembly plant to ev truck production, to late 2025. the car maker cited ""evolving ev demand,"" while also revealing the move will help it ""better manage capital investment.""
stocks reversed early morning losses by mid-afternoon trading on tuesday.
the dow jones industrial average (^dji) inched 0.3% higher, or about 100 points. the benchmark s&p 500 (^gspc) rose about 0.3% while contracts on the tech-heavy nasdaq 100 (^ndx) climbed roughly 0.2%.
at current levels, the dow and s&p 500 are set for their highest close since september 20, the day before the federal reserve established its higher-for-longer interest rate mantra.
treasury yields jumped on tuesday after strong retail sales data added to investor concerns that higher-for-longer interest rates are here to stay.
the yield on the benchmark 10-year treasury (^tnx) jumped roughly 12 basis points to trade around 4.83%. the 10-year yield hit a 16-year high of 4.89% on oct. 6.
the 30-year yield (^tyx) climbed about 7 basis points to trade near 4.94% while the 5-year yield (^fvx) rose 13 basis points to trade around 4.85%.
a hot jobs market is boosting consumer spending.
retail sales rose 0.7% in september from the previous month, more than double wall street's estimates for 0.3% growth, according to new data from the commerce department on tuesday. retail sales have now grown from the month prior for six-straight months, marking a consistent trend of consumer spending.
this, economists say has been supported by an average of nearly 270,000 nonfarm payroll additions over the same period. with no clear signs of the labor market fully cooling, the strong position of the us consumer entering the fourth quarter of 2023 could provide upside risks to inflation and therefore more fed rate hikes.
""the economy is entering q4 with more momentum than we previously thought,"" oxford economics lead us economist michael pearce wrote in a research note on tuesday. ""the risks to our forecast for a slight contraction in consumption in q4 are firmly to the upside. the strength of the economy also means that fed officials will leave the door open for additional rate hikes.""
fed chair jerome powell has noted in the past that a stronger us economy could mean more fed rate hikes.
""we’re not looking for a decrease in consumer spending,"" powell said on september. ""it’s a good thing that the economy’s strong...if the economy comes in stronger than expected, that just means we’ll have to do more in terms of monetary policy to get back to 2 percent [inflation]—because we will get back to 2 percent.""
over the past week, fed officials eased market concerns of another interest rate hike from the central bank as they explained how credit tightening caused by rising bond yields could effectively take the place of another fed rate hike. the discussion provided reprieve for bond yields and stocks rallied.
but that shifted on tuesday. markets are now pricing in a roughly 40% chance that the federal reserve hikes interest rates at its december meeting, up from a 25% chance just a week ago, according to the cme fedwatch tool. stocks opened lower after the report too, while bond yields rose. the 10-year treasury yield breached 4.85%, its highest level in more than a week and just off its 16-year highs.
“today’s strong report along with a recent string of positive economic surprises suggest the economy carried more momentum than previously thought over the summer,"" ey-parthenon senior economist lydia boussour wrote in a research note on tuesday. ""this will keep the federal reserve on high inflation alert, and though it won’t tilt the federal open market committee toward another fed funds rate hike at the november meeting, the december meeting will very much remain a ‘live’ one.”
the biden administration is upping its restrictions around the sale of semiconductors from american companies to china.
chip stocks like nvidia (nvda), advanced micro devices (amd) and vmware (vmw) all fell on the news, down roughly 6%, 3% and 8%, respectively, as the broader tech space lags the overall market.
the crackdown is the latest effort by us officials to limit china's access to ai chips, further escalating tensions between the two countries as the technology war intensifies.
us commerce secretary gina raimondo said the goal is to curb china’s access to ""advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to (chinese) military applications.""
big banks like bank of america (bac) and goldman sachs (gs) reported mixed results on monday as earnings season kicks into high gear.
as yahoo finance's david hollerith reports:
third quarter profits at bank of america were up 10% from a year ago, as the second-largest us bank got a boost from higher interest income and a strong performance from its wall street unit.
it reported earnings of $7.8 billion and revenue of $25.2 billion, which was up 3% from a year ago. its net interest income, which measures the difference between what it makes on its loans and pays for its deposits, rose 4% year over year.
its trading and investment banking revenues were also up, a sign that a slump in dealmaking is starting to thaw.
meanwhile, third quarter profits at goldman sachs fell as the wall street giant continued its costly retreat from consumer banking and tried to recover from a prolonged slump in dealmaking.
its earnings were $2.06 billion, down 33% from $3.07 billion a year ago. that result was affected by a $506 million write-down on greensky, a specialty lender it agreed to sell, and $358 million in impairments on real estate investments.
its performance during the quarter trailed other big-bank rivals jpmorgan (jpm), bank of america (bac), citigroup (c), and wells fargo (wfc), all of which reported profit increases year over year.

dow loses nearly 300 points after bond market pummeling: stock market news today,2023-10-20T20:07:38.000Z,Karen Friar and Hamza Shaban,"us stocks ended friday's trading session in the red, as the benchmark 10-year treasury yields hovered just below 5% in the wake of comments by federal reserve chair jerome powell.
the dow jones industrial average (^dji) fell 0.9% or 270 points, while the s&p 500 (^gspc) shed 1.3%. the tech-heavy nasdaq composite (^ixic) dropped about 1.5%. all three major indexes posted weekly losses.
stocks lost ground after powell signaled the fed is committed to its ""higher for longer"" rates stance, which spurred gains in treasury yields. the benchmark 10-year yield (^tnx) rose briefly to 5% late on thursday, a closely watched level not seen since july 2007.
“the underlying message is 'don’t be looking for a bailout from the fed anytime soon,'” greg whiteley, a portfolio manager at doubleline, told reuters. ""that gives people the go-ahead to take rates above 5%.”
on friday afternoon, the yield on the 10-year retreated from that key level, dropping to around 4.91%, as part of a broader recovery in fixed-income assets. but the ""pain trade"" in bonds could have further to run, even after weeks of putting pressure on stocks.
investors looking to earnings to lift the downbeat mood have yet to find relief, despite strong financial reports.
also still weighing on shaky markets is the risk of the israel-hamas war turning into a wider middle east conflict, after israel's defense chief hinted at a ground assault on gaza at the weekend.
wall street ended the day and the week in the red, as volatility in the bond market pulled stocks lower.
the s&p 500 (^gspc) lost 1.3%, while the dow jones industrial average (^dji) shed 0.9% or roughly 300 points.the tech-heavy nasdaq composite (^ixic) lost 1.5%. all the major indexes ended the week lower than when they started.
the largest and most influential tech companies are reporting earnings next week, providing a key perspective on the health of the economy and the impacts of the fed's tightening campaign. amazon, meta, alphabet and microsoft are among the dozens of companies reporting during the final full week of october.
investors will also get a fresh look at the central bank's preferred inflation gauge, alongside another survey on the mood of the american consumer.
how the israel-hamas conflict unfolds will also be top of mind for policymakers and investors. market watchers will also continue tracking the surge in bond yields as they hover just under 5%.
yahoo finance's brent sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week:
policymakers in washington are closely watching the situation in gaza, which risks expanding into a regional conflict and carries implications for the energy market.
fed chair jerome powell said in a speech thursday that the central bank is monitoring the developments for economic implications. ""geopolitical tensions are highly elevated and pose important risks to global economic activity,"" he said.
the potential for energy shocks comes from the region's role in the oil market, specifically how iran will respond as the violence escalates. earlier this week iran's foreign minister called for an embargo against israel, as the israel-hamas war approaches its second week.
""iran's involvement is the key focus for the crude market and this is essentially because they are a huge crude producer,"" rebecca babin, cibc private wealth energy trader, told yahoo finance live.
the turmoil could continue to push oil prices higher, injecting even more volatility into an energy market that has been at the forefront of the debate surrounding inflation. higher prices would further complicate the fed's mission to bring down inflation. and similar to the russian invasion of ukraine, dealing with the potential of a middle east energy shock would fall outside of the control of the central bank, even as the fed would have to contend with the fallout.
in the fed’s struggle to bring inflation back down to 2%, americans' expectations of where inflation is heading plays a crucial role.
fed chair powell keeps saying inflation is too high, and it’s not just because the numbers say so. it's also an attempt to set expectations. where inflation is concerned, what americans think will happen has a way of becoming what happens, just as the fed’s threats of more rate hikes are meant to foreshadow a future course of monetary policy.
""doing too little could allow above-target inflation to become entrenched and ultimately require monetary policy to wring more persistent inflation from the economy at a high cost to employment,"" powell said in a speech thursday before the economic club of new york.
the fed’s forward guidance and its use of public communications to steer policy can look and sound a lot like wishful thinking. but it does have real impacts. the threat of a hike can almost function like another phantom rate hike. and part of getting that desired outcome is repeating again and again that it will happen until it does.

yahoo finance's ines ferré reports:
a note to clients highlights a wall street journal survey of economic forecasters showing the consensus probability of a recession over the next 12 months declined from 54% to 48%. this is the first time the odds fell below 50% since mid-2022.
“our own 12-month recession probably remains unchanged, at 15%,” goldman’s chief economist jan hatzius wrote.

just before noon on wednesday, the yield on the 30-year treasury (^tyx) rose above 5% while the 10-year treasury yield pressed above 4.9% (^tnx). the benchmark s&p 500 index (^gspc) was near its lows of the trading session, down about 0.7%.
on friday, bank of america strategist michael hartnett noted 5% yields could prove to be an important ""line-in-sand"".
if yields go above 5% for an extended period, stocks could be in trouble, according to hartnett. he called 5% yields ""clearly a big line-in-sand for the fed.""
wall street's 2023 ai darling has hit a speed bump.
on tuesday, the biden administration announced plans to halt shipments of select ai chips from american companies like nvidia (nvda) to china. nvidia stock fell nearly 5% on the news and slumped more than 2% in early trading on tuesday.
analysts at citi believe there is a ""low likelihood"" of the us government granting export licenses to nvidia, prompting the firm to lower its sales estimates for fiscal year 2025 and 2026.
""we believe the scope of the new performance density thresholds will make it difficult for nvidia to sell to china,"" citi analyst atif malik wrote in a research note on monday.
citi moved its 12-month price target down to $575 from $630 on the news but maintained a buy rating on the chipmaker, citing ""secular ai growth which remains in early innings.""
nvidia is off about 12% from its 52-week high, which it briefly touched around after reporting another quarter of blowout sales in late august.

morgan stanley stock is down more than 6% after the company reported shrinking profits during its quarterly earnings release before the opening bell on wednesday.
yahoo finance's david hollerith reports
third-quarter profits at morgan stanley (ms) dropped 9% from a year ago as revenue from investment banking and trading fell, another sign that wall street is still struggling to recover from a prolonged slump.
investors signaled their disappointment, sending the firm's stock down roughly 6% in wednesday morning trading.
morgan stanley's performance placed it near the bottom of the big banks. its drop in profits was smaller than the 33% decline at rival goldman sachs (gs), but trailed increases at jpmorgan (jpm), bank of america (bac), wells fargo (wfc) and citigroup (c).
its investment banking revenues fell 27% from a year ago, placing it last among the big banks with sizable wall street operations.
investment banking fees at goldman sachs, bank of america and citigroup all rose from a year ago. at jpmorgan, these fees fell by a much lesser degree — 2.6% — for the same period.
morgan stanley's revenue from trading stocks and bonds was also down, by 4%. its wealth and investment management units both posted higher year-over-year profits but fell short of analyst expectations.
""while the market environment remained mixed this quarter, the firm delivered solid results,"" said ceo james gorman, who in may announced plans to step down as leader ""at some point in the next 12 months.""
stocks were lower at the market open on wednesday as rising middle east tensions sent oil prices higher and investors digested lackluster earnings from morgan stanley. 
the dow jones industrial average (^dji) fell more than 0.2% while the benchmark s&p 500 (^gspc) dropped nearly 0.5% and the tech-heavy nasdaq composite (^ixic) slipped 0.3%.
here are some of the stocks leading yahoo finance’s trending tickers page in premarket trading on wednesday:

nvidia (nvda): shares dropped by over 1% after a more than 4% decline on tuesday, after the us said it would tighten curbs on chip exports to china. however, the biden administration's new rules appeared to throw nvidia, along with intel (intc) and amd (amd), a lifeline in the hope it would help preserve the us chipmaking business. it was also reported on wednesday that foxconn will build a new kind of data center using nvidia chips and software.

ryan reynolds made over $450 million in just a few years but insists he's not a pro investor: 'experts have forgotten more about investing than i'll ever know',2023-10-20T14:00:11.000Z,Jeannine Mancini,"when people hear the name ryan reynolds, they might immediately think of the sharp-witted actor famous for roles like deadpool. but these days, reynolds is making headlines for a different reason: his skill as an entrepreneur. with a collection of business ventures that have sold for more than $2 billion, reynolds is proving he's not just a one-trick pony.
in an interview with ""mad money"" host jim cramer, reynolds delved deeper into his investment philosophy, particularly regarding mint mobile. he highlighted what he believes is a core strategy, stating, ""i think what we do really well over there is emotional investment. when you create emotional investment, you not only create affinity, but you also create resilience for a brand.""

he said constructing an ""emotional moat"" around a brand provides it with the ability to withstand ups and downs in the market.
another intriguing point reynolds made is his focus on essential services, setting himself apart from other celebrities who usually opt for aspirational items.
""phone service is an essential service,"" he said, emphasizing that it's ""something that is not provided by the government, something that everybody needs.""
for reynolds, mint mobile was an opportunity to tell a story about providing a key service at an ""utterly reasonable"" cost.

his vision aligned seamlessly with mint mobile's. he said the partnership with t-mobile is a way to broaden the reach of a product that millions of people depend on.
reynolds acknowledges that when it comes to the nitty-gritty of investing, the experts ""have forgotten more about investing than i'll ever know."" but his knack for tapping into the emotional pulse of consumers adds an unexpected layer to his investment strategy. it's not just about pouring money into a venture; it's about telling a compelling story that resonates with people. his goal is to arm brands with the emotional weight they need to navigate fluctuating markets.
this unique approach to investing — emphasizing emotional ties and focusing on essential services — has paid off for reynolds. the mint mobile deal reportedly netted reynolds over $300 million, adding to his profit from aviation american gin, which sold for about $610 million in 2020. the combined net profit is estimated at over $450 million.
while reynolds may joke about not being a financial wizard, his strategy reveals a different kind of wisdom: the power of emotional investment. reynolds has not only transformed his image from a hollywood actor to a seasoned entrepreneur but also redefined what it means to be a successful investor.
reynolds embodies an approach known as value-added investing, a strategy widely adopted by venture capitalists and angel investors who provide more than financial support. they offer their expertise, industry connections and sometimes their personal brand to significantly amplify the business's potential.
reynolds' celebrity status and personal branding are invaluable assets. by lending his name and reputation to a startup, he can fast-track its growth and attract a level of attention that would typically demand considerable time and resources. such influential involvement can drastically improve the odds of success, especially in areas like marketing, which can be a significant challenge for early-stage companies.
this popular investment strategy isn't limited to high-profile investors like reynolds. it has been democratized for retail investors through equity crowdfunding platforms like startengine. now, even those without deep pockets can participate in value-added investing, making meaningful contributions to startups in the form of capital, connections or other resources.

surging bond yields are the stock market's biggest problem right now,2023-10-19T10:00:22.000Z,Jared Blikre,"this is the takeaway from today's morning brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:

treasury yields continued their march higher on wednesday, with the 10-year treasury reaching 4.9% for the first time since 2007 in a move that sent stocks lower.
and while market history suggests stocks should rally into year-end, the continued sell-off in bonds is threatening to destabilize what's so far been a strong year for equity markets.
as investors sell bonds, prices fall and yields rise. and as this year's sell-off in the bond market deepens, the approach towards a big, round number like 5% for the 10-year yields can serve as a psychological magnet for investors, much the same way dow 30,000 offered a gravitational pull for investors back in 2020.
but it's not so much the absolute level that shakes markets as it is the speed of the change in prices and rates.
that's because bonds are expected to be the boring, stable part of a portfolio that doesn't move much. after all, treasury bills, notes, and bonds are considered ""risk free.""
except a lack of worry the us government will pay you back isn't the same as expecting the value of these securities to hold steady over time. a lesson investors are relearning during the federal reserve's rate-hiking cycle.
moreover, this move in the treasury market comes as the stock market's rally remains hyper-focused on a few key stocks known now as the ""magnificent seven.""
in a note on wednesday, torsten sløk, chief economist at apollo, noted the price-to-earnings (p/e) ratio for the s&p 493 — which excludes apple (aapl), alphabet (googl, goog), microsoft (msft), amazon (amzn), meta (meta), tesla (tsla), and nvidia (nvda) — has been steady at around 19 all year. (disclosure: yahoo finance is owned by apollo global management.)
for this smaller group of stocks, however, their collective p/e has risen more than 50%, to 45 from 29. in other words, investors aren't actually more excited about the prospects for most companies, just for a few.
""what is particularly remarkable is that the ongoing overvaluation of tech stocks has happened during a year when long-term interest rates have increased significantly,"" sløk wrote. ""remember, tech companies have cash flows far out in the future, which should be more negatively impacted by increases in the discount rate.""
now, expectations for the cash flows of this ""magnificent"" group in the future may be lofty, but these companies throw off huge sums of cash today as well. still, in sløk's view, this rally led by tech companies is ""inconsistent"" with the rise we've seen in yields.
""in short, something has to give,"" sløk continued. ""either stocks have to go down to be consistent with the current level of interest rates. or long-term interest rates have to go down to be consistent with the current level of stock prices.""
there are, of course, myriad other reasons stock prices and risk-taking in general could suffer in an environment of inflation uncertainty. or benefit should the outlook grow more stable.
but the bottom line for investors is that the longer the rise in yields persists, the greater the chance that the fed makes a policy error by not tightening enough or by tightening too much.
all of which increases the chance that the fed breaks something — and just what that might be we'll only know in hindsight.
